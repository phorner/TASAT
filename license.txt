The license of the Irrlicht Engine is based on the zlib/libpng license, only the name and the authors name have been replaced. Even though this license does not require you to mention that you are using the Irrlicht Engine in your product, an acknowledgement would be highly appreciated.

The Irrlicht Engine is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group. This means that if you use the Irrlicht Engine in your product, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you’ve used the IJG code, unless of course you recompile the engine without support for JPEG images. It would also be nice to mention that you use the Irrlicht Engine, the zlib and libpng. See the README files in the jpeglib and the zlib for further informations.
