          Each line is read from the file in turn.  The first charcter
          of the file (the tag) determines what the data on that line
          represents.

          #    The line is a for any comments

          @    The line names the SECTOR/SUB-SECTOR for the file.
               Display this information across the top of the map,
               after dropping the tag. No space after colon :

          $    The line contains a segment in a trade or X-boat route.
               The first 2 fields are the beginning and ending hex
               locations.  The last 2 fields are offsets for the
               the end location if it is outside the border of the
               sector currently being displayed.  If this type of
               segment is being entered, the segment end that is
               INSIDE the subsector must always be listed first.
               The offets indicate in which direction the destination
               is off the map, but are not required to indicate how
               far.  For the X coordinate, -1 is to the left and 1 is
               to the right.  For the Y coordinate, -1 is up (this is
               X Windows, remember?) and 1 is down.  Segments with
               both ends outside the subsector cannot be used.  All
               4 fields MUST appear in the columns shown.

          ^    The line contains a segment of a political, military, or
               cultural boundary.  The first field is the hex location
               and the second field is the edge of the hex.  Hex edges
               are numbered from 0 to 5, clockwise, starting with the
               top edge.

          Any line in the file starting with a character other than
          those listed above is assumed to be an entry for a star system
          within that subsector and must be in the format shown above.
          Each star system entry contains (from left to right) name,
          hex location, UPP code, Base code, system notes, TAS zone code,
          pop. multiplier/asteroid belt/gas giant data, allegiance code,
          and star types.  These field MUST appear in the columns shown.

 

Political Boarders:
  The next values are the 6 points of each hex, arranged in CoordModePrev. 
  format.  The 1st value is filled in during each pass thru      0        
  a double 'for' loop.  The points are ordered as follows:    5/   \1      
                                                              4\___/2 
                                                                 3      

  The next values are the 6 points of each hex, arranged in CoordModeAbs.  
  format (sort of).  Each point is an absolute value, relative to the      
  0th [x,y] point in the array.  This is used for rendering static borders 
  loaded from the data file, rather than entered interactively.  The point 
  ordering is the same as that in the hex_pts array (above).               

Each segment listed in the datefile has the following format (starting in column 0):                    

                 ^nnnn m

Following the carat (^), the nnnn value is the hex number and the m value 
is the side of the hex.  Valid values for n are 0-5, with the top edge of 
the hex as the 0 edge, and the other edges numbered clockwise.
