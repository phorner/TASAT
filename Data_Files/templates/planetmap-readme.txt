The planetmap.bmp template can be used to add your custom planet map.
Copy this file and edit it by opening up a paint program such as MSPAINT.EXE and draw/color/label your map 
on the hex grid.
Rename your copied file to the hex number of the system you want to use it for.  Example: 212.bmp (without 
the leading zero)
Move your custom map into the systems sector directory, such as for the Spinward Marches in the classic era
it would go into the:

/sectors/classic/59/data

Now every time you view the system planet map for Prinx/Spinward Marches 0212, you will view your custom 
map and not a pregenerated one.
