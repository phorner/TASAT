Grikr!ng sector. Mostly rift area (see Lesser Rift), a small cluster of stars occupies the spinward-coreward part of the sector. 

The trailing three-quarters of the sector is Lesser Rift area, but the A, E, I and M subsectors are normal density. There is a three-world K'kree Outpost in the sector, which includes the sector capital, Grikr!ng (Grikr!ng 0538). There is a (nine-world) Vargr client state, the Worlds of the Nine Starlords. Each of the worlds is governed by a dictator (one of said starlords), and all nine worlds are amber-zoned. There is also a third client state, the mostly Human, three-world Perdumon Alliance.
