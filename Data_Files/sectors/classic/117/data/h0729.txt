Rouen has always been a center of ornithopter enthusiasm, with notable training
schools and custom construction shops.  With the economization forced upon the
planet by technological retrogression and other aspects of the Rebellion, they
have become a much more significant part of daily life - few trips of under
100km are done by any other means.  The Rebellion hasn't changed the local 
attitudes of friendliness; it is by no means difficult to find people ready,
willing, and able to show an offworlder how to "spread their wings".
