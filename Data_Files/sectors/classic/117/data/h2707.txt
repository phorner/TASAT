Hike (Khavle/Diaspora 2707)

Hike is one of the two major repair/maintenance centers for starships on the
Khavle Main (Wake 3005 is the other).  Some ships do make the run to the class
A starport at Medora, but the majority remain on the Main.  Hike and Wake are
also used as jump-off points for convoys to Margaret's Domain for purchasing
high technology (which can be had at exhorbitant prices, but which can also
make exhorbitant profits in the sector).

Hike is hard-pressed to function as a starport maintenance facility, due to its
low technology level.  Efforts are being made to find financing for a
technological recovery to TL9; once that happens, Hike's starport will quickly
be upgraded to a full class B.
