In most of the sector, the ornithopter is a sport vehicle; here, it is an
essential tool for survival.  Garaag's sole water source is nightly snowfall,
requiring 'thopter-equipped scouts to range far and wide looking for areas of
significant snowfall, and gather the snow for transport and use.  Matters are
complicated by the reduction in population (by two-thirds from pre-war levels),
reducing the number of scouts available.
