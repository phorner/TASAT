Carl's World (Hijiri/Diaspora 0336)


The "Carl" that gave his name to this planet was Carl Sickles, a geologist/ prospector/entrepreneur who first claimed and settled the planet during the Terran expansion into the territories newly acquired from the Ziru Sirka.
The planet rapidly became a rich source of minerals for the expansion toward the core, and gained popular notice for the vast amounts of incredibly-large quartz crystals that appeared very close to the surface, and in outcroppings in riverbeds.  In addition to industrial uses, the crystals became a tourist attraction, attracting thousands of tourists each year for the raft ride through Prism Valley.

Sickles was a far-seeing individual, and made plans for the day when the minerals would eventually run out (they have yet to do so, 3300 years later). He set up a long-term process by which eventually the planet would be converted to an amusement park, continent by continent, as the minerals on each became exhausted.  There are now several large theme areas, including one small continent that has become a preserve for geneered re-created dinosaurs from the Terran Mesozoic era.

The most popular attraction is the "floating crystals", large aggregations of the large quartz crystals that the planet is known for, equipped with power plants, several weeks of fuel, and anti-grav drives.  These are used as flying "houseboats" by visitors, leisurely cruising the planet's skies at up to 30kph.
There are three configurations that may be rented: preprogrammed course to selected tourist sites; free-control to allow passengers to decide where to go; and no-control, floating anywhere with winds and atmospheric currents.  There are also larger models available for group excursions and conferences.
