Tensions between the Solomani and Cumberan confederations have escalated into
open war here.  The major powers are not directly involved, but the alignment
of each is clear in the choice of minor client states, allies, and proxies.
Various mercenary units are on-planet, spearheading offensives in these small
states.

The Solomani mercenary unit Torchevskeyev's Tacklers is on planet.  The
Tacklers are noted for their 431-year history of victory - and viciousness.
The Tacklers are currently in the employ of a small but well-financed nation;
that nation's opponent has put out a desperate call for mercenaries and other
troubleshooters to oppose them, but with limited success.  So far, only one
Cumberan grav armor troop has responed.
