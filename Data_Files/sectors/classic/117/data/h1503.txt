Channel (Libert/Diaspora 1503)

Channel's economy has received a major boost from the class B starport that has
so far survived the ravages of the Rebellion.  The neighboring world of Zeeland
has a large merchant fleet (and a large population to be served), but is unable
to maintain them.  They have therefore contracted with Channel to maintain and
repair that fleet.  Between Channel's food exports and their maintenance 
efforts (which keep the docks and yards running over capacity), most of the
effects of the Rebellion have been held off, and Channel is experiencing an
economic boom.
