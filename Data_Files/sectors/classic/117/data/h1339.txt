Nape (Shumisdi/Diaspora 1339)
E0005CB-3   As Na Ni         924 Na (Wilds) DOOMED

Nape is in serious trouble.  Its technology has declined to the point where
it can no longer produce air or water.  In an effort (doomed to failure) to
hold off their final demise, a policy of "100% biomass reclamation" has been
instituted, requiring all materials, including deceased citizens, to be
recycled to preserve the world's resources.  Resistance to the program is
growing, because the restrictions and requirements of the program make
emigration for all intents and purposes impossible, and attempts to illegally
tap the water tanks near the asteroid's core are increasing.  The reprisals
are often deadly, providing still more bodies for reprocessing.  Tensions
continue to rise.
