Tazmania (Promise/Diaspora 3123)

The Tazmanian government is actively seeking troops (mercenary, trouble-
shooters, or even vikings) to dislodge a pirate band that has landed on the
planet and which is raiding settlements in the northern uplands of the 
world's main continent.  The pirates' base is said to be fortified.

In actual fact, the pirates would be glad for a chance to leave; their ship's
maneuver drive was slagged in the crash landing.  Having no way offworld, they
have accepted their situation and taken up sustenance raiding.
