Ledge (Iusea/Diaspora 1223)

Ledge is perhaps the most tragic story in the sector, having lost fully half
of its pre-Rebellion population of 20 billion.  In spite of a three-year
conflict between Lucan's forces and Solomani forces, only about 300 million
were combat casualties; the shattering of cities and infrastructure led to
disease, starvation, dehydration, and lawlessness.  The fight continues; the
remaining Imperial troops (still nominally loyal to Lucan) are cadreing the
local government's armed forces, and are still in control of the planet.  The
remaining Solomani forces are in a defensive mode, holed up in the mountains
ringing the edge of the south polar zone.  The Solomani can claim support
from roughly 20% of the population, due to more humane conduct than that of
the Imperial troops and the planetary army.

With no remaining economic infrastructure to speak of, both sides have taken
to producing their own material, while seeking high-tech imports from offworld.
The government has managed to maintain production at TL7; the Solomani can
achieve no better than TL6.

Offworld mercenaries find ready employment here, mostly with the government.
Currently, the most significant mercenary forces on the planet are are two
regiments of TL9 mechanized infantry from the Vassalry Judiciate, supporting
the government, and some armored battalions from the New Order Vigilance
Alliance supporting the Solomani.

Skilled technicians of all types are in demand by both sides, and can command
high payment.  Also in high demand are clever scavengers.
