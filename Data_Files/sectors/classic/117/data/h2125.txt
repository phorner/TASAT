Moncton (The Blight/Diaspora 2125)

Moncton is the site of the abandoned Research Station Delta, and the home of
the unusual Swarmer, a shaggy, quadrocular multiped that grows more legs as
it ages.  Some old specimens have been observed with as many of nine legs.

Swarmer society has been observed to be complex, yet for many years no method
of communication between swarmers was ever known, pheromones, signaling
"plumage", sound production, and other "standard" methods of communication
having been ruled out.  It was not until 1108 that Imperial scientists at the
research station discovered that the "idiot gnats" that accompanied the
swarmers were in fact "cellular repeaters" for ultra-high-frequency radio
emissions.  These gnats are created in the swarmers' bodies and excreted in
their waste; they are nourished from secretions on the swarmer's skin.  Once
it was realized that the swarmers communicate via radio, Imperial scientists
were able to contact them the same way, and discovered that the swarmers had
a talent for linguistics.  Further research was cut short by the abandonment
of the station during the Rebellion.
