Quelleff (Narquel/Diaspora 0609)
D624710-C                     505 Ec (Outlands)

Quelleff is the Ecclesiasty of Narquel's primary point of contact with
outworlders.  The people of Quelleff do not subscribe to Panamica Orthodoxy;
as a result, the rulers of the Ecclesiasty have decided that "spiritual
contamination" should be restricted to the unbelievers of Quelleff.
This has led to a high level of traffic at the class D starport; plans have
been made (but not yet implemented) for expansion and upgrade.
