Talca (Libert/Diaspora 1407)
A100793-D   Na Va            813 Na (Outlands)

Talca is experiencing a boom due to increased demand for starship production.
Ling Standard Products and Sternmetal Horizons are both major producer here;
most worlds of the Libert Main come to Talca for their starships - but even
so, the majority of starship contracts here are from the Union of Sufren.

Talca is metal- and mineral-rich; this is the primary reason that most
shipbuilding is actually done on or below the planet's surface.
