In 1127, a corsair band in control of a 5000td ship with particle accelerator
bays arrived in-system.  The band were formerly members of Lucan's Navy who
mutinied after taking severe damage from forces loyal to Dulinor.

Upon arrival here, the band was able to destroy the planetary defenses, but
suffered the destruction of their jump drive in the process.  Stranded in the
system, the corsairs demanded cooperation of the locals, under pain of total
destruction of the population.  The locals refused, and took refuge in the
deepest levels of their community.  The corsairs landed, and took control of
the environmental controls of the community.  The locals were thereby forced
to return to the upper levels and serve the corsairs.

The corsairs encourage traffic in the system, but the situation is tense.
There is an ongoing campaign of assassination, terrorism, and sabotage against
the corsair band; reprisals are swift and severe.  The corsairs have given up
on their attempts to repair or replace their jump drive, and now attempt to
recruit passers-by into enforcement roles, offerring positions of power and
wealth in their occupation force.  Not revealed is that life expectancy in
these positions is short.
