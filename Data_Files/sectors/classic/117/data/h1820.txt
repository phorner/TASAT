Remington (Alurza/Diaspora 1820)

Remington is the favorite last port-of-call for ships leaving the Alurzan Loop
to cross the Eberly Gap.  Astrographically, Mogumba (1821) is the last stop on
the Loop, but most captains do not opt for planetfall there, preferring to
refuel at one of the gas giants.

Remington has a large amount of commerce with Promise (2827), located some
distance to trailing.  Most of Promise's starships are constructed here, and
delivered by large convoys via Thicket (2424).  The so-called "Thicket Run"
has become a lucrative commercial corridor, and personnel and ships to serve it
are always in demand.  Great gains, high salaries, and lucrative contracts are
possible, but risk is high:  Promise is in the Wilds, and piracy is common in
that area.
