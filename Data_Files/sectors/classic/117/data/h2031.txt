Hewlett is the second chokepoint in the Eberly Gap.  It is widely known for its
lax customs officials, whose eyesight is reputed to get worse in proportion to
the number of credits that they receive.  There are thriving black and "gray"
markets at the starport, but there is very little crime elsewhere on the
planet, as the government does strictly enforce the few laws it imposes.
