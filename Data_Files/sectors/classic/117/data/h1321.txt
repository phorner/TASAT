Birii (Iusea/Diaspora 1321)
E1005A6-6   Ni Va            102 Na (Outlands) FAILING

Birii, like Hammet (1328) and Shoehorn (1123), found itself with a problem
obtaining water as a result of the Rebellion.  Unlike those worlds, which
went to outside contractors to solve the water problem, Birii has managed
to solve it on its own.

Birii is an iron-cored moon of a large gas giant.  The next moon out is a
small icy body.  The Birii government has managed to outfit a fleet of TL6
space craft to shuttle back and forth between Birii and the icy moon,
bringing water and hydrogen in on every trip.  Birii itself is mined for 
the essential metals and ores necessary to support the space fleet.

In addition, hydroponics facilities have been established on the icy moon,
reducing their dependence on imported food.  The new hydroponics facilities
now produce 50% of the food needed on Birii.

The self-reliance of Birii is even more remarkable when one considers the fact
that fully half of the local population has died or emigrated over the past
ten years.
