Waverly (Madoc/Diaspora 1733)
XAA7282-3   Fl Lo Ni         600 Na (Wilds) DOOMED

Waverly is in desperate straits.  Its technology is no longer sufficient to
maintain the planet's environmental system against the unbreathable atmosphere.
However, the few ships that stop here are not mobbed by desperate emigre want-
to-bes as on other doomed worlds; instead, evacuation is handled in a somber
manner, with the government politely requesting to purchase as many low berths
as the ship can handle.  The low passages thus purchased are then distributed
among the population by lottery.

Those who attempt to stow away or otherwise illegally attempt to gain passage
are executed by exposure to Waverly's lethal atmosphere, with the entire
population required to watch, to emphasize the seriousness of Waverly's
situation and the necessity of adherence to the lottery.

The grim approach is paying off; many ship captains have come to respect the
people here, and most try to come back for extra passengers, sometimes making
a few passages "on the house".
