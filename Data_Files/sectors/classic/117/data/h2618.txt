Dema (Pasadaruu/Diaspora 2618)
X200400-4   Ni Va            300 Na (Wilds) FAILING

Dema is a sad example of what planetary regression can entail.  With the
planet's environmental systems in a state of near-total failure, it managed to
survive by contracting with Samaran merchants to provide low-level maintenance
in exchange for ore cargos (at no cost beyond the performance of the
maintenance).  However, hardship worsened, and with hardship came anarchy.
The system slowly became a pirate haven, and the planet's economy now depends
on the unsavory clientele.

A recent practice has become forced (by the pirates) "marriages" between
pirates and locals.  This supposedly bodes well for continued maintenance of
the planetary environmental systems, but is cause for sadness among the locals,
who conceal it behind eager, ingratiating smiles when the next pirate band
comes to call.
