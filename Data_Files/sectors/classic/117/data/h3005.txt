Wake (Khavle/Diaspora 3005)
B6525A9-9   Ni Po            300 Na (Outlands)

Wake is one of the two major repair/maintenance centers for starships on the
Khavle Main (Hike 2707 is the other).  Some ships do make the run to the class
A starport at Medora, but the majority remain on the Main.  Hike and Wake are
also used as jump-off points for convoys to Margaret's Domain for purchasing
high technology (which can be had at exhorbitant prices, but which can also
make exhorbitant profits in the sector).
