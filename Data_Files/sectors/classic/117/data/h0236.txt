Doom (Hijiri/Diaspora 0236)


This former prison world was "liberated" with the help of Solomani troops. The planet is now ruled by the oldest, wisest, and most ruthless of the criminal masterminds among the inmates.

Doom poses as a supplier of rough-and-ready mercenaries; this is actually a cover for their real objective of attracting black-market investment into the development of the planet into a major smuggling power in the region.
