Ornithopter flying has long been a popular sport and recreation.  Since the
Rebellion, the inhabitants have taken to using them for local travel.  This has
had the benefit of extending the useful life of the remaining grav vehicles.
In addition to local travel, many inhabitants have taken to hunting from the
air.  While difficult, it is nevertheless strongly encouraged, so as to reduce
the planet's dependence on imported foodstuffs.
