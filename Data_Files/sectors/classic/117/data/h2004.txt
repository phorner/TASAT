Sufren promises to be the area's major power in the post-Imperial era.  It has
maintained a high technology level (E [14]), and is a garden world to boot.
Because of this, it has experienced a boom in population growth, primarily due
to refugee arrivals.

Sufren's government maintains a naval shipyard which builds all of the planet's
military ships; commercial ships are produced offworld at present.  Local
business interests are working to upgrade the port to a full class A rating.

In addition to the human population of six billion, Sufren is home to large 
populations of sapient orcas (two million) and dolphins (unknown, but at least
as many as orcas).

The extensive Ancient site is well-preserved.  However, recent access has been
highly restrictive, and now requires personal interviews and background checks.
The exact reason is unknown, but connections have been drawn with incidents on
Umorphutwyo, and there are rumors of classified research being done by Sufren
Naval Intelligence.
