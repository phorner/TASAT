Kandom (Alurza/Diaspora 2116)

Kandom is divided by a succession war between the government and Duke Geraldo,
who fled here after being forced to abandon Backman during the succession wars
there.

Duke Prester Geraldo has much support among the middle and lower classes of
Kandom, and two companies of grav-belt infantry from the Union of Sufren are
also supporting him.  He is expected to remain a force vying for control of
the system and the subsector for the forseeable future, in spite of his being
declared an outlaw and forced into hiding.
