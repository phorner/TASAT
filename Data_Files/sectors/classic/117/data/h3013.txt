Karroo was seized in 1128 by a mercenary band built around a renegade Army

mercenaries due to poor supply, they chose to acquire real estate instead.
The selected real estate was Karroo.

25% of the local population supports Captain Shakala Iirdiisi.  The rest would
rebel, if they could get offworld help, but Iirdiisi has prohibited suspected
partisans from leaving the planet or even working near the starport.  This
prohibition is enforced by the death penalty.

Skerret Adan's mercenary company is assembling a strike force to deal with the
invaders at the behest of the Union of Sufren.  There is a high demand for
unit commanders and line troops both.
