Ruffian (Madoc/Diaspora 1933)
D448593-9   Ag Ni            314 Na (Outlands)

Ruffian is aptly named; the startown here is known for its rough-and-tumble
character, and the rest of the planet isn't much better (the Justice Ministry
can't keep up with the caseload).

The world is a chokepoint in the Eberly Gap, and a port-of-call for almost
every ship through the Gap.  Contracts and Patrons of all types can be found
here, and viking bands often recruit here (some masquerading as locals), as
well as making their availability for hire known.
