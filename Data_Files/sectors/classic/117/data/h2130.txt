Eberly is a welcome port-of-call for most ship captains since the Rebellion;
it means that half the Gap has been traversed.  Eberly's starport, renamed
Halfway Starport, boasts lively trade, a lively startown, and a lively black
market.  Halfway Startown is a major center for intrigue and skulduggery
between the Solomani and anyone who wants to monitor or impede their activities
in the sector.
