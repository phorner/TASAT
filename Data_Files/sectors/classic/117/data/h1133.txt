Although Frey has suffered several invasions, it is well-preserved, and is now
making extensive investments in its security.  These investments take the form
of encouraging homesteading by "viking" bands, with the twofold purpose of
providing a defense force (as they protect their home) and providing revenue
for the planetary economy from their earnings from hiring out as mercenaries.
