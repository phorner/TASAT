Quafe is owned by CommerStar Industries, Ltd., the second most powerful
faction on Libert.  The planet is trying to resist the factionalism that
has wracked Libert, but CommerStar attempts to gain control of the Quafe
Consulgruppe have led to increased friction between CommerStar and the
locals, and open talk of secession.  It is rumored that troops from the
Vassalry Judiciate have been smuggled on-planet to aid the locals in the
event of a revolution.
