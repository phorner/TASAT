Montezuma (Khulam/Diaspora 2836)
B562762-B   Ri               104 So (Frontier)

Montezuma is currently occupied by Solomani forces.  Despite strong Solomani
roots, there is little local sympathy for the Confederation, and local
collaborators are few.  Covert off-planet Montezuman agents are attempting to
hire mercenaries and other armed troops to fight the occupation forces.
