After their honorable release from service with Daibei, the Six Gun Colonial 
Army returned to find the local government in complete disarray.  They then
proceeded to force the departure of the Bones Colonial Proctors from the
planet, and took over the functions of the government.  However, they are more
hierarchical and orthodox than the Proctors they displaced.

The Fishing Admirals of the Six Gun Sweeper Fleets have requested that the
junta step down from power; the Army has responded by dispatching naval units
to deal with the "seditious buccaneers".  The Fishing Admirals have contracted
with a company of Cumberan light infantry to oppose the Army.

The local Chirper population of about 20 million is uninvolved and uninterested
in the pending civil strife.  They continue to produce mutated offspring
designed to thrive as amphibians.  This is a trend that has been noted for the
past 200 years; the birthrate of these amphibious Chirpers is now up to 10% of
all Chirper births.
