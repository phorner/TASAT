Ferry (Shadigi/Diaspora 0512)

The ManuFactors Associative, a commercial combine that dominated the planet
prior to the Rebellion, now runs the planet outright.  It occupies a strategic
location connecting Shadigi subsector to Narquel subsector, and is a major
source of high-tech goods for the core-spinward portion of the sector.

The mercenary trade and the planet have found mutual benefits in the Rebellion
era; the mercenaries pay well for the high-tech military equipment that Ferry
can produce.

Ferry's high-tech cargos are more likely to be found on the richer worlds of
the region; most of Ferry's clientele are operating larger ships (600td or
more, with Jump-2 or better) than can be supported by the poor worlds closest
to Ferry.
