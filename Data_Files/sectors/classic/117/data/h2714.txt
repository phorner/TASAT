This system has always been something of a pirate haven, with the belt being
little more than a collection of pirate shantytowns.  With the Rebellion, the
loose and informal pirate organization has become a powerful, almost cult-like
organization headed by the charismatic pirate leader Indro the Lightless.

Indro has declared the "Lightless Peace", making the entire system a weapon-
free zone.  All individuals in the system, whether pirate or no, are strictly
enjoined from committing violence of any sort.  The only exception to the 
prohibition is one small moon of the outermost gas giant in the system, called
"Duel".  If that's not what you're there to do, you have no business being
there.
