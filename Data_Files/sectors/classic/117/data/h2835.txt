Chirpers have long been a feature of the community here, living in a hydroponics park/preserve.

When the planetary service grid was knocked out in 1119 by terrorists, the
life support margins did not permit all of the chirpers to be saved.  Food
shortages compelled the use of chirper carcasses as meat.  Now, with the
situation worsening, there is much debate in the community over whether the
remaining chirpers should be sacrificed to reduce the agricultural demands
of the hydroponics farms.

This underscores an important point: While Imperial decree and long tradition
recognize chirpers as sentient, there is a tendency to see them only as clever
pets.  As times get more difficult, the assessment of the chirpers has dropped
still further; even formerly compassionate people now view them as livestock.
This has no doubt inflamed Droyne emotions throughout the sector.

Acorn's people do not welcome questions from outsiders about the reduced
chirper population.
