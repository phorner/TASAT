In 923, a mysterious plague wiped out half the population of the planet, then
known as Gretus.  The disease was never isolated; there were suspicions that
the Imperial Navy's rapid move to interdict/quarantine the planet was an
attempt to cover up a failed biowarfare experiment.  The survivors of the
plague are all asymptomatic carriers of the causative virus.

After the plague disaster, the locals managed to rebuild their society to TL7,
at which point the Rebellion intervened.  The planet was subjected to attacks
by the Solomani; local efforts to control war damage to essential
infrastructure drained manpower and other resources from other sectors of the
society.

There are rumors that some Solomani fighter pilots have crashed here but not
become infected.  These rumors have not been confirmed; travellers who make
contact with the natives do so at their own (considerable) risk.
