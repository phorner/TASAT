Cosenza (Promise/Diaspora 3228)
C527464-8   Ni               312 Na (Wilds)

The legitimate government of Cosenza is advertising for mercenaries on Promise.
They are offering what almost any band would be glad to receive in payment,
which includes gold ingots and a shipment of radioactive ores.  The mercenaries
are to be used to dislodge a band of pirates that have seized the planet.

Promise is willing to commit a squad of its own troops to the rescue effort,
but is looking for freelancers to plan and lead the attack.
