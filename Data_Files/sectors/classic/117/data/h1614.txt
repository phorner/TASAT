Nike is one of the few planets in the sector still capable of significant
starship manufacture.  It is the primary supplier to the Alurzan Cartel, the
Vassalry Judiciate, and other buyers along the Libert Main.  The main
shipyard here is controlled by Takakusi Ways, Inc., a subsidiary of General 
Products, LIC.  This has led to some concerns about the reliability of hulls
laid at Nike, due to GPLIC's unenviable recent track record.
