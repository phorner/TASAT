Wapiti (Kushga/Diaspora 0913)
E326363-A   Lo Ni            913 Na (Outlands)

Wapiti is currently occupied by troops from Byrna.  After a protracted strike
by the planet's miners, the Wapiti Tech and Trade Council requested aid from
Byrna, making generous offers of recompense.  Byrna accepted on that basis,
and sent a squadron of mercenary cruisers equipped to TL9.

While there were no incidents requiring actual intervention by the mercenaries,
significant amounts of sabotage and other damage crippled the local economy,
causing the Tech and Trade Council to default on their promises to the Byrnans.
The Byrnans have therefore declined to withdraw.

Wapiti has sent out contractors to attract mercenaries throughout the
subsector, hoping to gather enough strength to dislodge the Byrnans.  They are
quick to point out Wapiti's loss of sovereignty under foreign "invaders", but
neglect to mention that the invaders were invited, that Wapiti defaulted on its
commitments to the invaders, and that they are likely to have trouble meeting
their obligations to mercenaries.
