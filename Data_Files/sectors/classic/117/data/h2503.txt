The Tsinan Ornithopter Endurance Rally draws ornithopter enthusiasts from
throughout the sector, many of the most eager of whom make their homes here.
The Rally hasn't missed a year since before the Rebellion, and the government
has vowed that it will continue to be held every year.

The Rally includes a segment that takes participants lengthwise over Tsinan's
largest desert; checkpoints are placed on oases.  Usually, a Tsinan participant
wins the Rally; a participant from Sanborn wins roughly once in three years,
and occasionally a lucky winner will come from another planet in the sector.
