Avat (Alurza/Diaspora 1713)
D2005CA-8   Ni Va            123 Na (Outlands)

Now a major transit point between the Libert Main and the Alurzan Loop, Avat
was formerly a sleepy backwater planet.  The increase in traffic has brought
an increase in crime, however, resulting in the government becoming more strict
and totalitarian.
