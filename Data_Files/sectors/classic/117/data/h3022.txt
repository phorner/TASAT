Asena (Promise/Diaspora 3022)
E354832-9                    114 Na (Wilds)

Asena has experienced widespread destruction comparable to planets subjected
to war measures, but here they are the result of internal disputes rather than
external action.  The disputes are over cultural matters, economic imbalances,
and military suspicions.

The local society is stratified by age, leading to a rigid gerontocracy.  This
structure is said to stifle offworld trade, but hardliners are unwilling to
relax policies; liberals want to relax currency and property laws to draw more
trade.

The conflict has recently heated up; Duke Starkar Berens (title abated by Lucan
in 1122) has gathered a following, including troops from the Union of Sufren
and Skerrit Adan's regulars.  The duke hopes to use these forces to control
his homeworld, and eventually the entire subsector.  He is rumored to have
Solomani backing as well.
