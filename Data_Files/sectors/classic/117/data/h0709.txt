The state religion is known as Panamica Orthodoxy, and is best described as
"militant pacifism": all sophonts are eventually expected to submit to the
Infinite Wisdom and Goodness of the Unknowable One and Its secular ministers.

The original form of Panamica takes its tenets from the gentler parts of the
creeds of Taoism, Jainism, Buddhism, Judaism/Christianity, and other Terran
traditions.  Panamica Orthodoxy is a radical offshoot.

Until recently, the head of the religion (and the government) was a single
Theocrat; the last Theocrat was overthrown by the Council of Ministers, who
now rule as the Theocratic Administrate.  The current expansionistic 
attitudes date from that overthrow, and some observers have suggested that
the Administrate is using religious fervor as a shield for their own
political adventurism.
