Aazuni (Sufren/Diaspora 2405)
D2104A6-9   Ni C:0           211 Na (Outlands)

This former colony of Forward is at the center of a political tangle.  Forward
is pressing the Khavle Accordment (which Aazuni is not a member of) for
assistance in reasserting its supposed colonial rights.  Aazuni has no wish to
return to colonial status.

Accusations and unconfirmed reports of forced sterilization of the local
Chirper population have complicated the situation; there is agitation from
several quarters, including some groups funded by interests in the Vassalry
Judiciate, to force intervention to end the "passive genocide".  It is also
reported that the Judiciate is prepared to intervene directly; a Judiciate
troop ship is in orbit about the planet, awaiting orders to land.
