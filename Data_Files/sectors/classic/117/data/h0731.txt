Tulane is used as a training ground for the Tsinan Ornithopter Rally by many
ornithopter enthusiasts in the region.  Tulane's ornithopterists have a long
tradition of being the most graceful, though not the strongest, due to the
low gravity and dense atmosphere.  An interesting relationship has developed
between the 'thopterists and the local Chirpers (who have retained some
capability for flight in this environment): the Chirpers love playing a form
of aerial hide-and-seek with the 'thopterists in the mountains of the southern
hemisphere.
