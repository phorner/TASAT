Waken (Ebasha/Diaspora 0227)


Waken's cities are all multi-level subterranean "underground arcologies". A revolt in the largest city prompted Ebasha (0228) (the parent world) to request help from the Solomani to control the situation.  Solomani Security was only too happy to oblige, and sent two 10,000rd frigates armed with particle-accelerator weapons and a 10,000-person Expeditionary force.  The response to rebel activities by the Expeditionary Force is swift and brutal; occasional reprisals against innocents have been reported.

Waken expatriates have recently learned that the frigates have left the system, bringing hope that the Solomani can be pushed out.  They are currently looking to find units willing to mount counterstrikes.
