Sofar cannot support their class B starport with only TL7.  The Solomani have
offerred aid in rebuilding the infrastructure and restoring higher tech levels,
but the International Diet (the local legislature) is deeply divided over
accepting the aid.

The division over the issue has led to violence, but the Confederation,
represented in this subsector by Reform-influenced commanders, has declined
to intervene, taking the position that if Sofar can settle its problems on
its own, it legitimizes Confederation assurances that Sofar would retain its
sovereignty.

There are rumors that the anti-Solomani Rejectionist Alliance has hired viking
bands to attack the pro-Solomani Redevelopment nations, but no attacks have
occurred as yet.
