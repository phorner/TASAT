Duumur

This industrial world lies somewhat off the main trade and communications routes. It has an extremely profitable industrial base, made possible in part by the ability to dump waste heat and pollutants into the environment. On the other hand, Duumur is dependent on imports for a large fraction of its nutrients and organic raw materials.
