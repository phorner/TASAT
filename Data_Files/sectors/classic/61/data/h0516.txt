Raiga

When first colonized from Ian in the late 100s, Raiga had a thin, tainted atmosphere. Volcanoes were broken open to raise the atmosphere density and bacteria were sown to remove the taint from the air. An unforeseen burst of radiation from Raiga's primary caused some of the bacteria to mutate into a deadly strain. While the original taint had been largely removed, the mutated bacteria proved fatal to most human inhabitants. A few developed an immunity . While these "immunes" have grown to a sizeable population, the planet is quarantined to non-natives. The natives can not leave, either, since they are carriers of the deadly bacteria Lucellia Raigae.
