Umaraag/Sashrakusha

The IISS base at Umaraag has begun legal proceedings against the Naval base at Sumeszu/Sashrakusha (Corridor 2632). Naval medics from nearby Umaraag took 120 chirpers for research purposes from a reserve on Umaraag, where chirpers comprise over 60% of the population. Scout personnel maintained that such action violated the laws protecting the reservation and the chirper's right to live unmolested.

Initial ruling in 1114 favored the Navy, and the Scouts subsequently appealed the decision. The policies of the "real Strephon", favoring equal treatment of both natural and artificial sophonts, offer a new source of hope for the IISS.
