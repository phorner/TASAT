Cafad

A low tech human population was discovered here. The Vilani efforts to integrate the Cafad humans into their Grand Imperium progressed slowly. The world relapsed into barbarism at the onset of the Long Night. After centuries of contact with the Third Imperium, Cafad has only now started to re-embrace technology.
