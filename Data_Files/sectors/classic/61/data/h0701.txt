Gzorraeth/Khouth

Owned by Ulroudzoe Mining, a major corporation based within the Dzarrgh Federate. Ulroudzoe established Gzorraeth as its first extra-Federate mining operation. The world has become Ulroudzoe's chief supplier of radioactives.

Imperial authorities suspect Ulroudzoe of manufacturing fission warhead on Gzorraeth and selling them to corsairs. Although the claim has never been validated, many feel that destruction of the Ulroudzoe facilities on Gzorraeth would deal the illicit Vargr arms race a major blow.
