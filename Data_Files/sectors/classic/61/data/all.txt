Corridor

Strategically important sector containing 267 star systems dramatically split by the Great Rift: 69 systems lie spinward of the Rift and were originally settled by the Vilani before the Vilani Imperium was established, and 198 systems form the coreward third of the sector. Corridor is named for its role connecting the old, well-established Vland sector with the frontier sectors of Deneb and the Spinward Marches. The name Corridor dates from about 140, and had displaced the former Vilani name (Eneri, which is approximately translated as "star salad") for the sector.


Brief History
Because Vilani attention turned primarily rimward and trailing, Corridor sector was relatively ignored by the First Imperium. A few limited settlements were established at Mikesh (to exploit mineral deposits) and Khukish (because of the exotic local biologies), but no large scale colonization took place.

Vargr expansion between -2400 and -1700 moved large numbers of Vargr into Corridor, and demonstrated that the sector had greater strategic significance than previously realized. Through the Long Night, many worlds in the sector became Vargr-settled; once the Third Imperium was established and began to expand spinward, Imperial steps were taken to secure the region. The Vargr Campaigns (220 to 348) were fought in Corridor, Deneb, and even Vland to establish Imperial authority.

The Imperium dominates the sector. Vargr worlds still exist beyond the Imperial border. In addition, there are numerous Imperial client-states and non-aligned systems within the sector.
