Ishirdu

The taint of radioactive gases in the atmosphere of Ishirdu led to the evolution of the psionically gifted Irdu, who live in widely scattered woodland homes and supply their needs by telekinetic manipulations. The population of two thousand is optimum to them, and they maintain it carefully. Their psionic skills shocked the Scouts of the Rydel expeditions, and the Navy interdicted the world, despite the non-aggressive character of the Irdu.
