Kanorb

Kanorb has a long history of settlement and fractious politics. Kanorb was a stronghold of Vilani noble houses in the First Imperium; it withdrew from interstellar commerce early in the  Rule of Man period. When the Solomani attempted to re-integrate Kanorb by force, the population put up fierce resistance. The Solomani Navy was so overtaxed by the vastness of the Second Imperium that they were never able to must enough force to fight a conclusive battle with Kanorb. After the Rule of Man fell, several of the Vilani Lords began quarrelling with each other, no longer having a common cause to unite them.
