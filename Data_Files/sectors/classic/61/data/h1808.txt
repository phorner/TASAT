Lemish/Lemish

Lemish's starport and industrial capacity were severely damaged by recent vargr raids. The planetary governor fervently declared his unwillingness to pay protection money to Vargr corsairs. In retaliation, the Vargr mustered a fleet and sacked the planet, specifically concentrating their attacks on the port and manufacturing complexes. The planet's technology dropped three levels. The shipyards were totally destroyed, and the other port facilities were barely functional after the attack.

At present, rebuilding efforts are in progress, but the disruption of interstellar trade in the sector has prevented the inhabitants from getting crucial supplies. Remnants of the Vargr fleet  continue to patrol the system, and travellers are advised to avoid Lemish if possible.
