Tarin Sink/Ashishinipar

An Imperial client state and site of Corridor Research Station Epsilon. Nine extended families colonized the planet in the 300s during the wave of spinward expansion. Most current inhabitants are their descendants.

The Imperium later established a separate facility manned by ts own personnel. It grew until it was officially designated Research Station Epsilon. Epsilon serves as a clearinghouse for unexplained phenomena. Within it are records of bizarre happenings and mysterious relics dating backs tens or hundreds of millennia. Untranslated nonhuman accounts and strange engines predating the First Imperium await the person able to read or operate them.

Many items in the station's collection are so odd that they are freely displayed to the public, although Tarin Sink's position within the Great Rift limits the number of visitors. Imperial researchers, completely baffled by these objects, hope that someday someone will pass through the station who can shed some light on these mysteries.
