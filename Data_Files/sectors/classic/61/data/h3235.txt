Sharkagu

The Corridor sector was first entered at the world Sharkagu (Corridor 3235) by ships of the Sharurshid merchant company out of Sakin (Vland 0135). Sharkagu, only 1 jump away, strongly resembled Sakin and the colony there has maintained close relations with the mother planet throughout its history; indeed, it never requested independence throughout the Long Night, and remains a Sakin colony to this day.
