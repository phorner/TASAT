Plunge

Plunge stands at the head of the great Ushamla Main that spreads commerce coreward of the Great Rift. Many of the planet's eight billion people live in tunnels hollowed into the planet's crust. Trade has brought great wealth to Plunge, and the biggest businessmen are the leaders of the government. Their powers are dictatorial, but they have the respect of their underlings.
