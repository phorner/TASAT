Lasher

The star Lasher is a subsector all to itself. The Navy discovered extensive deposits of lanthanum on an inner planet of the system. The planet's insidious atmosphere makes the mines difficult to work, forcing cumbersome protective gear and short work sessions. The entire population of 600 lives in an orbital rotating torus constructed by the Navy.
