Neghu Oug/The Narrows

The population is an uneven mixture of Vargr and Ojehshodu, the world's indigenous minor race. The Ojehshodu are a race of large, aquatic mammals, unsuited for life on dry land -- very little of which exists on ocean-swathed Neghu Oug. The technologically unsophisticated Ojehshodu readily submitted to foreign rule when the Vargr arrived; even today, their contributions to the planet's administration are practically invisible.

Interestingly, one Vargr sociologist, Dartsongze, suggested in 972 that the Ojehshodu ran the planetary government, manipulating the Vargr leaders as unsuspecting puppets. Dartsongze was murdered within weeks. It is uncertain to this day whether he had uncovered an Ojehshodu plot or was killed at the request of insulted Vargr politicians.
