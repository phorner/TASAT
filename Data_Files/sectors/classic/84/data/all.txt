Gateway Sector

Tranian
Archduke of Gateway. As archduke of the domain with the smallest proportion of territory actually within the Imperium, Tranian's dynasty was always the least powerful of the archduke dynasties. However, following the Civil War, this domain's powers were the least diminished by succeeding emperors. This was largely due to the fact that no emperor of the flag came from this region, and the armed forces of the region remained on the side of the Imperium instead of any particular emperor. 
Tranian has few duties in the domain which cannot be administered from Capital, where he resides for most of the year. He is a powerful voice for tradition and honor in the Moot, and so the Imperium as a whole.
