Gvurrdon Sector known as Briakqra' in the Zhodani Consulate. 

Gvurrdon Sector is dominated by numerous Vargr governments and it borders with both the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate, resulting in a region of diverse cultures, political unrest, volatile trade and frequent raids. Such a place might seem chaotic and unstable to Imperium and Zhodani citizens, but to the Vargr it is simply their way of life. The sector is part of the Vargr Extents, spanning the coreward and trailing quarter of the Gvegh-Aekhu region. There is a good mix of both the Gvegh and Aekhu cultures but the coreward strip consists primarily of Gvegh Vargr.
