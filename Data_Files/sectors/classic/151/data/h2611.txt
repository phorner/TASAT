HOLLIE  2611

Hollie, Gurnek(2713), and Tikai(2811) comprise the
Polity of Hollie.
Hollie is still in the process of forming a world government. 
The one holdout, Vasbato, still wants more consessions about off-world colonies 
and trade. Rumors suggest that SolSec may become involved if an agreement 
cannot be reached soon. The Vasbato government says if SolSec interfers they 
will go to war.
