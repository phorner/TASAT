History

First settled in -2266 TI by a colony ship from the Terran Confederation.


Kemit has kept a watchful eye on the activites of the Solomani Confederation 
believing them to be a worst threat than the Aslan to the peace of the 
subsector. Every attempt to place SolSec sleeper agents in the populus has failed for unknown reasons.
