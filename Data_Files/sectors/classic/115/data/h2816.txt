Aries is little more than a hollowed out 1600km asteroid in orbit of the system's largest gas giant, a brooding red orb known as Cerabus.  More than 20,000 naval personnel and support staff inhabited this massive fortress.  Built as a small naval shipyard and testing ground visitors to Aries are actively discouraged by the Imperial Navy.
