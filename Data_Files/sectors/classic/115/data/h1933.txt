Originally colonized by Solomani during the Interstellar Wars, Rintarna 
has tended to remain aloof of formal interstellar political ties. It has
sizable system defenses but no offensive fleet to speak of due to an 
extreme scarcity of lanthanum in the system. Officially, this seems to be 
why the organized raiders that plague Reavers' Deep and Daibei in the 
1120's pass Rintarna by. 

Unofficially, it is known that quite a large portion of the pirated goods 
found their way to Rintarnan markets, after very flimsy laundering at 
nearby freeports.  In the early '20' s by a combination of luck and good 
judgement, it also managed to acquire the services of several starmerc 
bands and a number of repairable warship hulls. With this new navy they 
are able to keep important trade routes to Rintarna open as well.
