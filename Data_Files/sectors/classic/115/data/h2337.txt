A green world, full of life and marked by islands, Bakuur is an isolated world near the edge of the Solomani border. Originally the scout base on the world was established after the Peace of Ftahair to monitor Aslan movements. The inhabitants of the world readily agreed to become a client state in return for the expected increases to trade. This did not eventuate until the formation of the Solomani Confederation. Since then Bakuur has become a trade route between the Confederation and the spinward worlds of the Carrillian Assembly.
