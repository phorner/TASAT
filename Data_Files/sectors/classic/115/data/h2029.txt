Drellesarr was colonized in the era of the Reavers by the great Reaver
warlord Blackjack Duquesne as a refuge for his raiders. This original
settlement for raiders has turned into a a sprawling underground
settlement called Blackjack.

Blackjack is a Freeport in every sense of the word. A lawless, wide-open
frontier community, the colony serves as an open port where repairs,
alterations, and improvements can be performed on visiting starships,
equipment legal or illegal purchases, goods marketed...all with no
questions asked.

Drellesarr's government is headed by The Commodore, who commands the
system forces and enforces the will of The Captain's Council. The
council grew out of a collection of Reaver ship captains, but today
represents the leaders of the various technical and commercial factions 
located in the system. The Commodore is elected by the Council, but is
historically the current commander of the system defences and also holds
a prominate position on the Council.

Several subsector corporations have offices in Blackjack, including
Dakaar Minerals, Caledon Ventures, and Carellines Ltd. Blackjack also
has hasa factors from at least three Aslan clans.
