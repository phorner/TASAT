Carrillian Assembly
 
The second largest independent human-dominated political entity in the sector. The Carrillian Assembly is a group of federated worlds joined for the mutual regulation of trade, economic coordination, and common defense.  The capital of the Assembly is in the Carrillian Belt/Drexilthar (Reavers' Deep 2330). The entire  Assembly is considered to be an Amber Zone for any non-Carrillian  traveller passing through it.
