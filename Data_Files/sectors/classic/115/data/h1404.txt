H'Oskhikhil are an Intelligent minor race native to Storm. Members of this race are disk-shaped, 0.5m high and 1.5m across. Their world's eccentric orbit has moulded their lifecycle into two major phases: the civilised adult which, after reproducing, is consumed by the hungry juvenile.

This process has kept the race from developing an enduring technological society until relatively recent times. The adults have learned how to construct armoured, air-conditioned shelters where they can live to pass on their culture and technology to the next generation.
