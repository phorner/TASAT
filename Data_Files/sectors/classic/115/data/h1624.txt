Iltharans

A minor human race, native to Drexilthar. Extremely agressive.  The Ilthara
recieved starflight technology from a Reaver warlord, Grand Admiral Izanak,
during the waning years of the Long Night. Within 50 years, they carved out 
a minor empire, later defeated and destroyed by the revolts on Duncinae,
the Principality of Caledon, and the returning Third Imperium.   It is 
believed that the high water mark of the Iltharan Empire ended with the
bombardment of Drexilthar in 268 by the Imperial White Fleet.
