Htalrea is a primitive world, one of many undeveloped planets lying 
between the Grand Duchy of Marlheim and the Confediracy of Dincinae.  It is
of greatest interest to Aslan traders, and it's major export is risth
scent. Htalrea is the home of the risth, a large, dangerous predator whose
scent glands are a source for rare and expensive perfumes.
