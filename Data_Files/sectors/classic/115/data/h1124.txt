The planet harbors a native sentient race, the J'aadje. The population of Gaajpadje is governed by the Gaajpadje Oligarchs who rule the balkanized  city-states of the J'aadje Nations. Inhabiting a separate, eastern  continent of the world are the T'Kring, a militaristic human race. Tensions  between these two groups of inhabitants continue to run high, but the  planet's oceans are an effective barrier to large-scale warfare.

Adwuj -- A syrupy beverage native to Gaajpadje (Reavers' Deep 11 24). It is usually served hot, and is made from the fermented sap of several trees native to that world.  Human visitors describe the taste as  bitter-sweet, and a cross between licorice, cinnamon, and burnt wood.

'jaadje  -- A non-human minor race native to Gaajpadje. They are small  (adults mass 60 kg on the average), agile, golden-skinned bipeds. Their  society is peaceful and courteous, and they are likewise courteous toward  off-worlders. J'aadje civilization places lesser importance on technology,  instead stressing philosophy and the arts. Graceful and delicate artforms  and workmanship of high commercial quality are the norm, fetching  excellent prices among admiring off-world buyers.

The population is ruled by the Gaajpadet Oligarchs who rule the balkanised city-states of the J'aadje Nations. Tensions between the J'aadje and the K'Tring, a militaristic human race inhabiting the East Continent, continue to run high.

K'Tring -- Warlike humans inhabiting Gaajpadje's eastern continent.  Descended from the crash of a starship 2,000 years ago, the K'Tring are  believed to be related to an obscure sub-species of Drexithar. With a  tech level of 6, the K'Tring are currently planet-bound.
