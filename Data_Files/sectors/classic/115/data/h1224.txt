Tlaosierlahrau -- Also known as tlao spice, tlao, or seasongold; a spice popular with both human and Aslan gourmets. It is derived from the seed of tlaosier, a tree found on Roakhoi. The golden seed kernels, when ground, produce a fragrant, light seasoning for meat, soups, and stews. Because of the scarcity of tlaosier, and the expense of shipping it, tlao spice commands an impressive price in off world markets.
