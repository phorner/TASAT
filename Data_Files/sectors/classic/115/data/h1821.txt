The story of Dakaar is the story of the Dakaar Corporation, a firm founded three centuries ago on profits earned from a lanthanum strike on Dakaar by a handful of independent miners. The lanthanum vein they opened was one of the richest ever discovered in the history of Reavers' Deep, and the miners founded a company that was eventually to become a subsector-wide conglomerate.
