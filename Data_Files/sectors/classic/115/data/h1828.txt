In 1104, a largely intact Iltharan base was discovered, dating back to the Reavers Era.  It has been described as "a treasure house of Reaver Era technology and knowledge ." Unfortunately, it was sited over top of a very rich vein of lanthanum.  The research base, staffed by scholars from Falkayne College, Grendal, and Andrew University, Stuart (Reavers' Deep 1716), has kept the destruction of the site under injunction fromDakaar Metals for 15 years.

Iltharans
A minor human race, native to Drexilthar (Reavers' Dee p182 6). Extremely agressive.  The Ilthara recieved starflight technology from a Reaverwarlord, Grand Admiral Izanak, during the waning years of the Long Night. Within 50 years, they carved out a minor empire, later defeated and destroyed by the revolts on Duncinae (Reavers' Deep 1624), the Principalityof Caledon, and the returning Third Imperium.  It is believed that the high water mark of the Iltharan Empire ended with the bombardment of Drexilthar in 268 by the Imperial White Fleet.
