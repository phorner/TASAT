Aikhiy is an agricultural world run by the Aikhiy Development Trust, a company owned jointly by Gralynite and Venecian interests.  The  company's interests were highly diversified and it proved able to  survive the worst of the depression.

The Aikhiy system was originally explored by Aslan clan scouts and a small colony was placed on Aikhiy by the Loakhtarl clan circa -80.  Never fully successful, the residents were one of the first of their colonies to succumb to the Turmoils.  All that remains of the Aslan colony are a few ruins and the world names.  After the Peace of Ftahalr, Aikhiy was settled by humans recruited by the Aikhiy Development Trust as an agricultural world for Venice (Reavers' Deep 1534) and Gralyn (Reavers' Deep 1735).
