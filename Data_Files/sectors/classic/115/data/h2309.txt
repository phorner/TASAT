In -676 a colony ship from the Reaver kingdom of Orpheus Roye left Oloma to settle Cuslets.  Upon jumping into the system the ship suffered a manoeuvre drive malfunction and the ship crash landed off one of the world's islands.  The crash survivors salvaged as much as they could from the ship before an approaching storm caused it to slip from the edge of the underwater shelf it was on.  Thus the ship was lost to the survivors but the colonists were a tough group and eventually the colony thrived.  The population of Cuslets are fiercely proud of their ability to survive almost any situation their world throws at them.
