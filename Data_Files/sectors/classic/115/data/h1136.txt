Danelag was settled during the Rule of Man by a Racial Purity Group from 
Scandinavia. Raided heavily during the Long Night, the world was later
invaded by Aslan and Human forces alike. Since then the population of 
Danelag has been very insular, thoroughly convinced that Outsiders (they
spell it with a capital "O") is nothing but trouble.
