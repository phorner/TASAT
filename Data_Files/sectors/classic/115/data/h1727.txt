Traneer was the first world settled by the people of Drexilthar during the formation of their interstellar empire.  Previously uninhabited, it was colonized during this period primarily by Tring and Akakhad political refugees.  The world's fortunes rose and fell with those of Drexilthar, and the end of the empire brought an economic and technological collapse on Traneer.
