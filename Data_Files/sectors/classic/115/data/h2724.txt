Virushi are a massive minor race hailing from Virshash, they are often described as "centaurs with tank blood" or "intelligent bulldozers." Contrary to what their physical appearance seems to imply, Virushi are pacifistic and (when talking in a standard atmosphere)  soft-spoken.  They feel obligated to serve in the common good, but can not be ordered to undertake actions against their will.
