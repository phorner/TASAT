Like many independent worlds in Reavers' Deep, Hihlas has an economy 
dependent on a single product. Fickleweed, a migratory plant used for
perfumes and in the production of aquapur, a local liqueur known and 
prized throughout the sector is this world's sole export. Over 90% of 
the population lives in mobile grav homes imported from Soloman. The 
current hostilities between Dalbei and the Solomani Confederation is 
causing a depression on Hihlas, corcing the population to settle down 
and convert to more appropriate cash crops.
