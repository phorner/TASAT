Asteroid belt mined by a mix of aslans and humans under the auspices 
of the Ekaftouh Treaty Administration. Failing trade and pirate attacks
have pushed the system to the brink of disaster; several habitats have
suffered life support failure and others survived only by cannibalizing
parts from failed or abandoned habitats. Most of the aslan clans have 
already pulled their people out.
