Anatar, Tharrill's sister world, was settled by the Carrillian Assembly and was, with the exception of a considerably chillier climate, virtually equal in potential to Tharrill itself. Both colonies thrived until, about two centuries ago, disaster struck Anatar. The Red Plague of 922 was one of the most horrible catastrophes in human history. 
  Rumour has it that, during the evacuation, a starship carrying a large shipment of valuable paintings, sculpture and other priceless pieces from the Planetary Museum crash landed somewhere in the wilderness north-west of the capital city. Two expeditions have visited the world in hopes of locating and salvaging the lost artwork.  Both of them contracted the Red Plague, two survivors came back from the first expedition and none from the second. This has caused fresh consideration of the problem and has led to the theory that the virus can be absorbed through exposed skin as well as through the lungs. No one has been willing to test this assumption, however, by another visit to Anatar.
