KIMU

The primitive maniku observed that lightning-caused fires roasted the pods of a tree whose pods are poisonous when raw.  The maniku began carrying torches from these fires to set off other patches of trees.  Unfortunately this also sets off brush fires and trims the maniku population somewhat.  The maniku are not sentient despite their use of fire.
