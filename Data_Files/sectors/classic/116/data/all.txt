  Daibei is one of many settled long ago by the Vilani as they created their First Imperium.  Under the Vilani, it was an undistinguished region far from the Imperial capital.  It has been off the major travel routes and treated as an unimportant backwater.  During the Long Night, Daibei suffered as much as any other sector from the loss of trade and collapse of technology.  In addition, Daibei sector was located squarely on the frontier with the newly expanding Aslan culture.

Aslan clans moved into the sector and settled on many of its worlds.  When human and other native races in the sector resisted, a series of low-level raids known as the Aslan Border Wars (-1118 to 380) became the norm.  Over more than a thousand years, the sector was subject to incessant Aslan raids and settlement, and in return the sector launched incessant raids into Aslan territory.

Finally, in 380, the Third Imperium stabilized the frontier by imposing the Peace of Ftahalr on all of the major Aslan clans.  Its provisions established a buffer zone 30 parsecs wide between Imperial and Aslan space, and made neighboring Reaver's Deep sector a cosmopolitan interstellar community.  Under the provisions of the treaty, the Third Imperium also guaranteed the safety and security of Daibei sector, pledging Imperial forces to ensure the matter.  Peace with the Aslan continued for 700 years.  Threats to the sector have been greater from the Solomani Confederation than from the Aslan Hierate.

SOLOMANI SPHERE:  The region dominated by the Solomani - a sphere around Terra - extends to cover half of Daibei sector, although it did not include any Imperial territory in Reaver's Deep.  The Vilani worlds in Daibei limited Solomani expansion, much as they did in Old Expanses.  Fighting during the Solomani Rim War missed Daibei entirely.
