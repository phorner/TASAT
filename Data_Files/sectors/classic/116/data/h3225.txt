805-111

People of 805-111 consider violence to be the primary means of settling differences.  While nominally unified, the planet is "governed" by a shifting panorama of cliques, gangs, private armies, and strongmen.  It seems the constituted government changes with every coup.

Locals fight anyone, anytime, with or without any notice given.  Offworlders rarely have a chance of avoiding all the possible offenses that could get them killed, so the Traveller's Aid Society posts warnings and the Imperial Navy enforces them.
