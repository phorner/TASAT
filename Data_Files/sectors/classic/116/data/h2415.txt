GILDEN

The people are divided into 17 clans with assigned territories that were agreed upon early in the world's colonization history.  This gives each clan control of certain resources and industries, as well as such agriculture as can be managed on a near-desert world.

Children are raised collectively by the clan after about age 3, and are trained to work in one of the clan's specialties.  Interclan marriage is possible, but not common - when it does occur, the woman joins the man's clan, and is retrained for a new duty.

Gilden was settled by refugees from Wagnild who fled during Wagnild's human genetic experiments.  Those experiments eventually proved to have negative side effects.  Difficulties in dealing with or acceding the "artificials" (as they were called by locals) lead many "naturals" (another local term) to relocate to Gilden.  Genetics became a proscribed science on Wagnild and a taboo on Gilden.  Still, for all their advanced technology, Gildenites have largely ignored the perils of inbreeding.  An increasing percentage of birth defects has been bringing down the working population significantly in the last few decades.

Efforts being made by some clans to encourage cross-clan marriages are resisted by other clans.  One stubborn clan has dwindled to a mere 200 individuals, because many of their children have died and most of their women have married into other clans.
