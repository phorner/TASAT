VAAL

Though listed as an agricultural planet, Vaal also has some of the richest lanthanum  deposits in the sector.  So rich in heavy metals is this small  planet that its volcanoes exhale lead oxides regularly, tainting the dense atmosphere.  A few plants have adapted themselves to remove this taint and make metabolic use of it.  These few are, of course, not edible by the human populace.

The lanthanum deposits make this planet an attractive target for Solomani excursions. The naval base at Sotto has kept a close eye on the system and its near neighbors.
