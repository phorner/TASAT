Banners Sector (Imperial coordinates -2/-5), is located Rimward of Ustral Quadrant Sector and Spinward of Hanstone Sector. Banners is named Iyiyukhtoi'  in the Aslan Hierate. It was also known as Intoam  at one time. 
The sector is beyond the borders of both the Hierate and the Solomani Confederation, though the influence of these polities is felt through trade and client states. Banners contains three small interstellar states: Aoiftu Roakh, which controls 24 systems in J and K subsectors; the Delsun Comagistrant, which controls 4 systems in N subsector; and Woal Warliylr, which controls 25 systems in C, F, G, and H subsectors. 

Matrix, the homeworld of the Inyx, an aquatic Minor Race that is influential throughout the rimward worlds of Charted Space, is located within Banners.
