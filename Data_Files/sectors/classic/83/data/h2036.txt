Bastis is the only one with any significant population.  Settled by religious dissidents some five centuries ago, this planet is mostly dead sand.  The population lives in domed oasis cities near the poles.  The major form of animal life is the Sandworm, a large legless, semi-reptilian herbivore.  While some forms of Sandworm do secrete valuable drugs, the target of most hinters is the Slink, a very large carnivore.
