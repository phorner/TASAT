The fourth planet out in a system of seven, Vilaruby is noted for its forests.  Most of the available land area is covered with a cool forest.  Not a jungle or rainforest, this special ecosystem has a very large number of furred, aboreal predators.  While most of the creatures are of moderate to small size, the fur is of exquisit quality.  Much of the planet is unmapped, and no other valuable resources are known.
