Alenzar

Alenzar itself is a colony built into the largest of a swarm of asteroids in a very close orbit around an old red star. InStarSpec maintains a major corporate office in the colony, which was settled originally by company employees. The colony has expanded somewhat since the early days of Alenzar's development, but the class C starport is still considerably larger than is needed by the colonists. Traffic into the system is small in volume, consisting mostly of company ships and a few prospectors searching for prized cerulene crystals.
