Raschev

Raschev is a fairly large world, measuring 13,000 km in diameter with a standard atmosphere and water covering 90% of the world surface. The planet is a largely agricultural world with extensive farmlands and a major fishing industry.

The climate is quite Earthlike, but the inhabited areas are concentrated in the southern temperate zone on a single subtropical continent; the weather here tends to be rather more moderate than usual for Earthlike planets, with temperatures usually ranging around 10 to 25 degrees Celsius.

Although Raschev is an unimportant world and an unlikely marketplace, it lies on a safe route for jump-1 starships to the center of the subsector. Raschev was first settled by colonists from the Imperium about two centuries ago. It remains a comparative backwater, and off-world ships rarely land, with the exception of a packet from Garoo (Spinward Marches 0130) every 3 months. As a result, there is a general attitude of respect, even awe, for off-world technology; the people are inclined to look up to off-worlders in general and Imperials in particular. Raschev's single continent is a jumbled mixture of rich farmlands, broken terrain, mountain ridges, and forests. The towns are small, each having perhaps 8,000 to 10,000 inhabitants. Most of the towns rely heavily on the fishing industry for their livelihood, although privately owned farms are also numerous in the open areas around them.

An Imperial technical assistance mission constructed a fusion power station in 1102 which supplies power to most of the inhabitants. Budget cutbacks and the rising tide of war in the Spinward Marches have caused that project to end, but the inhabitants maintain the station.
