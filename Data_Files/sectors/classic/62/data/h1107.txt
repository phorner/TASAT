
The only reason this world's incredible law level has not made it an amber zone is that offworlders are not subject to the most stringent taboos.

Colonized during the First Imperium with a dome ecology, Sikilar was a popular retirement world, because of its low gravity. As the Long Night deepened, it was cut off completely from interstellar contact. Technology became the province of a social class. The domes were maintained by rote knowledge, but their atmosphere became thinner over the centuries. The population physically adapted to this change.

Then an ambitious adventurer with few scruples arrived from a higher tech world. Dhusa (the only name now remembered) awed the populace with his "magic", and set up a religious dictatorship. Since then his priestly caste has instilled a terrified obedience in the people. Offworlders are worshipped as angels. No native may speak to an offworlder without permission. The priests handle all trade and keep all technology to themselves.
