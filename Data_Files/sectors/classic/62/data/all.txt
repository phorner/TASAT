One of the largest jump-1 chains of worlds in the Third Imperium. Almost two-thirds of the worlds in Vland sector can be reached from Vland by a series of one-parsec jumps.

It is one of the oldest, richest, and most cohesive sections of the old empire. 
Maps produced before the Rule of Man call the Main by the original Vilani name, Arshukaa Sagalaa.
