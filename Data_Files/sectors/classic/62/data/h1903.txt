
Imperials rarely visit this world except to purchase its famous high-tech weaponry, especially neurotoxins. A fortified naval base is here to keep Gemid's high military technology from neighboring non-aligned and Vargr states. No pressure, however, is being exerted to bring the world into the Imperium, because of its unusual culture.

High population and scarce resources have led to ritual killing of the old. A person's parents must be dead before he or she can have children. If they are not dead when a child is born, the new grandparents are expected to be killed shortly after the birth.

Culturally, Gemidians adapt to this custom in various ways. Married couples often wait until their forties or fifties before starting a family. (Gemid's high medical technology makes this possible.) Children of important figures in society may delay having children until the parent dies a natural death.
