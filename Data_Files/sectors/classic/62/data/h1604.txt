Although listed as a trinary with asteroids and a gas giant, the gas giant is a supergiant with a fairly large amount of internal fusion. Studies done over the last 320 years indicate it has reached a critical size, and may be on the verge of becoming a fourth star. The belters, already coping with eccentric freeze-or-fry orbits, view this possibility without enthusiasm.
