
This sparsely settled world is a smuggler's paradise. Its non-aligned status keeps it free from Imperial restrictions, and its close proximity to Gemid supplies it with a variety of black market goods. The system's gas giant provides cheap fuel, and it is only jump-2 to three different worlds just across the Imperial border. It is jump-3 to Anarsi, the subsector capital.

The Marquis of Gemid is the latest in a long line of ineffectual rulers. Historically, the Marquis of Gemid ruled all the worlds within jump-2 of Gemid (1903 Anarsi), but during the Long Night these worlds gained independence. The current title is an anachronistic position with no ruling power.
