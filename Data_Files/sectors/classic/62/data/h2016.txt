
Zurrian produces the famous shurshi cloth. This delicate, iridescent material is strong for its weight, and a shurshi garment retains its beauty for many years. The cleaned cloth is shipped all over the sector, and beyond - for those who can afford it. The local aristocracy claims 10% of the harvest, but otherwise leaves the populace to its own devices.

This fantastically expensive substance is produced by a local insect which has been altered and conditioned to spin its webbing in sheets. The natives keep hives of them as other humans keeps bees, and harvest the cloth periodically. Attempts to raise these insects elsewhere have failed.
