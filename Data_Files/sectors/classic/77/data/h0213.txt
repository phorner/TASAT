
Floriani: A minor human race native to Floria, the Floriani are notable for their dimorphism. The ruling group, the Barnai, are short and weak, while the workforce is comprised of Feskals, large, muscular, and unintelligent. Other minor details of anatomy also set them apart from the rest of humaniti.

Although accusations of slavery or exploitation might be voiced in Imperial society, the relationship between Barnai and Feskals is perfectly acceptable to both parties. High ethical standards combine with the stoic Floriani demeanor to foster cooperation and solidarity in defiance of physical differences.

The Floriani are also noteworthy for their unusual path of technological development. High;y advanced in the realms of transportation and weaponry, the Floriani are abnormally backward in the life sciences. Within the Florian League the masses have notions toward technology, and all Floriani instinctively shy away from true research. Even creativity in the arts is a rarity.

Floriani expansion began in -170, when Barnai technicians managed to duplicate a jump drive found in a wrecked Aslan ship. Contact with the Imperium followed in 185. The Florian League itself was formed in 506. A hierarchy of councils governs the League, where councilors are chosen from among the Barnai populace by lottery.
