627-301 is a ring of many small worldlets (planetoids AKA an "asteroid belt"), not capable of retaining an atmosphere or water, and is also a low-population vacuum environment with a population less than 10,000 sophonts in population size, warranting hazardous environment precautions. Life in a vacuum requires great discipline. After all, it only takes one forgotten seal on a vacuum suit to spell death. Those who survive tend to be very methodically-minded and attentive to small detail. This a "forbidden" world designated as a Red Zone with an environment, laws, customs, life forms, or other conditions that make it extremely dangerous to visitors. Everyone is forbidden to travel here.

The gravitational center of 627-301 is not the main star, but rather a black hole that the sun orbits around. The system's Research Station orbits a gas giant that orbits the star. The star, asteroid belts and gas giant orbit the black hole at 154 A.U. The system red zone is a precaution from the radiation hazards of the black hole.
