Jdakrief (0439) is a tidally locked world, colonised about the year 
 1000 by a Zhodani splinter group that ran out of money before the 
 colony was finished. The few thousand colonists stranded there tried 
 to make a go of it, but the task was beyond them. Sitiefladr (0638) 
 decided to take the world over, so it sent some warships over and 
 "made them an offer they couldn't refuse". This gave Sitiefladr a 
 colony without the cost of setting up the infrastructure. 

 The colony has since been expanded, but is mostly used as a holiday 
 resort for rich executives. The starport (now upgraded to type B) is 
 associated with this colony. Passing ships may come and go as they 
 please, despite the prison world status, for the few entrances to the 
 camps are heavily guarded. 

 The rest of mainworld and the star system consists of various kinds of 
 high law level prison camps.
