Eblplons (2532): With only a trace atmosphere, this mining and support facility was ruthlessly run until recently taken over in a coup led by a woman named Chtalfent Kiench Fleqrivr. She has ruled the outpost for the past five years with the support of the workers, maintaining the previous production standards but with a much happier work force. A landing field and fuel supply are maintained to encourage merchants to visit often, if irregularly. 

There are also occasional visitors who search for the old Vlazhdumecta supply base which is believed to be located somewhere in this system. The locals post a standing reward of Cr 50,000 (or twice this value in ore) for discovery of the base, since it would bring extra traffic to the world and boost the economy.
