Whahwhiv (0839) is a water world with a two main archipelagoes and a 
 few other small islands. All islands feature a central volcano, some 
 of which are active. 

 The atmosphere is dense with a high oxygen taint, which made it 
 attractive to the recent Talpaku colonists. The name of the world 
 cannot be translated in Galanglic (it describes the feeling of 
 suddenly breathing sweet, unpolluted air, like a human city dweller 
 breathing country air for the first time). The colonists have set 
 themselves up on a few of the islands and exploit the ocean for food 
 (both from ships and undersea habitats). There is considerable marine 
 life, helped by the high oxygen taint. The colony is yet to proceed to 
 the next stage of development and is not formally part of the 
 Communality (it is a client state).
