Qriensh Jdazh (0837) is a captured high density planet in a highly 
 elliptical orbit about the primary, out of the ecliptic. At certain 
 points in the orbit, the world enters the habitable zone of the star 
 and life blooms. The population harvests the unusual lifeforms that 
 have adapted to these conditions and extract various chemicals from 
 them. The rotational period of the world is 37 hours. 

 The planet is very rocky and craggy, with many active volcanoes, each 
 surrounded by an ash plain. There are only 7 tectonic plates (called 
 basins, locally) of any size on the world, surrounded by mountains and 
 ravines caused by plate movements. Each of the basins has a government 
 of its own, most being companies.
