Bliazheprvlaf (0435), like Plafrezhdish (0138), has a large star 
 (luminosity class F size II) visible from Zhdant and named by the 
 Zhodani in pre-space flight times. 

 The primary has no habitable planets, due to the position of the 
 companion star. The companion has some planets of its own, one of 
 which is marginally habitable and has plant life. The atmosphere is 
 tainted with a hallucinogenic gas mix and a number of harmful pollens 
 and spores. 

 The large primary is of interest to Zhodani astronomers. They have 
 impressive unmanned sensor arrays close to the star and two small 
 manned habitats several AU out from it. Most astronomers live in the 
 main base, which orbits the habitable planet. From here, they monitor 
 their sensors remotely. They use the mainworld only for water, 
 gathered by ocean dipping, since the vegetation is unsuitable for 
 human consumption. 

 The Talpaku suspect that the Zhodani have an ulterior motive and it is 
 rumoured that they will pay a substantial reward for evidence of this. 
 They claim that some of the sensors probe Talpaku space, using their 
 technological advantage. Resupply ships skirt Talpaku space, which 
 also worries the Talpaku.
