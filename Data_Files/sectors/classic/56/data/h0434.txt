Flibishichtia (0434) has an atmosphere tainted due to the low 
 percentage of oxygen (treat as Thin). The locals have adapted to the 
 oxygen level over the generations, but offworlders need respirators. 
 There are few large animals, so the locals have adopted a vegetarian 
 lifestyle. 

 The inhabitants are of Zhodani stock and have little to do with 
 offworlders, dealing mostly with the scientific base on Bliazheprvlaf 
 (0435), for whom they provide supplies. The world's rotational period 
 of 27.5 hours is very similar to Zhdant, which makes it appealing to 
 colonists. 

 The world is run by a group of families, which control the technical 
 sector of the economy. These noble families have recently begun to 
 exploit nearby Chtashekldlanz, competing with certain Talpaku 
 companies there.
