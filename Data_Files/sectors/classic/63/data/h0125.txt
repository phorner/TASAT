Kiur

A large, very dense world rich in heavy metals with a dense hydrocarbon atmosphere, making Kiur almost a sub-gas giant in a system composed entirely of gas giants. Its 71 million inhabitants live in orbit to escape the atmosphere of methane and ammonia.

The atmosphere can be easily skimmed and purified for fusion fuel, but what really sweetens the dismal aspect of this world is the ocean of pure hydrocarbons. These are scooped and sold to lower tech worlds that still burn them for fuel. A good example is Surli, 5 parsecs away.
