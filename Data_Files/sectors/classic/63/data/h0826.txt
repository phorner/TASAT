Mashnamii

Houses a seagoing culture transplanted from nearby Shuama (0927). The 15,000 inhabitants live out their lives on sailing vessels, coalescing into seven small nation-fleets during the winter and separating again for summer. Ships fly the colors of their particular allegiance, and sometimes prey on foreign boats. Vessels range from one-family craft to three-masted ships carrying up to 400 people.
