Dynam Depot

Home of 1200 mothballed ships, some dating back to the Third Frontier War. 150 from the Spinward Marches were mothballed after the 3FW. (All Regal battle cruisers?) 300 from the Solomani Rim were mothballed after the SRW. The rest may be just the normal retirements from Lishun Fleet.
