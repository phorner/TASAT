Takaria

The settlers here are refugees from Akitilon (3101), a client state that was taken over in 1023 by Zakishe (3004) in a bloody war that decimated the populations of both worlds. As of yet, the Zakishean invaders have not been able to track down all the refugees in the forests of Takaria. The remaining populations of Zakishe and Akitilon , under technocratic rule, are not enough to field sufficient troops to capture the refugees.

The only way the Takarians will ensure their continued safety is if the technocratic rule of Zakishe is overthrown. The Zakisheans covet the nearby pleasant, liveable worlds, but their power depends on controlling access to technology and all but forbidding it to the conquered Akitilonians.
