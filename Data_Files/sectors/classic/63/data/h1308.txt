Jebiina

A boom town in the midst of a plain old fashioned gold rush. At the same time, since Jebiina has no government, a "free land" rush is attracting dissatisfied residents of Adawi. Leaving Adawi is legal, but re-immigration is prohibited. The taint of Jebiina's atmosphere consists of various gases from volcanoes; their concentration is insufficient to discourage outdoor activity. Participating in either rush is dangerous, but the rewards can  be more than worth it.
