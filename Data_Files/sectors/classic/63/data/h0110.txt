Ashki

A water world, the home of the so-called electric algae, which are neither algae or normally electric. They are scavenging amoebae with a blue-green pigment; its function is quite different  from chlorophyll. In stormy weather the copper-based pigment collects static charges as lightning strikes the water. When charged, the amoebae group themselves into colonies of many strange shapes, held together by intertwining of the individual cells' cilia. The tendrils of these colonies shock fish with the accumulated charges and thereby enrich the feeding ground of decaying matter on the shallow sea floors where the amoebae live.
