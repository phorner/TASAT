This world has put most of its high-tech expertise into devising comfortable housing for its 45 billion people. The world is famous for its beautiful, free floating "air cities", which hover in the atmosphere at many different levels and rarely, if ever, touch the planet's surface.

All available land on the planet's surface is farmed, forested, or mined, often with the aid of climate control. Subsector and planetary governments each have a single massive air city to themselves.
