Asli

An offshoot of the very successful asteroid culture of Parshi. Both systems are administered by graduates of Parshi's exclusive Academy of Asteroid Sciences. Upon graduation, each scientist is assigned to the rule of a cubic trillion kilometers of asteroid belt, either opening new territories or replacing a dead colleague. The hollow asteroid worlds of Asli and Parshi are considered wonders of the Imperium, both for engineering excellence and human comfort.
