Khoez-toeng-thos

A Vargr advance military base `colonized' using orbiting starships.

The alleged "colonization" of this planet by Vargr using "orbital complexes" (actually just big starships) isn't fooling anybody. Imperial military experts believe the Vargr are using the world as an advance base, since Khoez-toeng-thos just happens to be adjacent to some very pleasant Imperial worlds. As a result, many of these worlds are strengthening their system defenses; the Imperial Navy is discussing plans for a new base on Untida.
