Khikaba

Site of the notorious Meson Rebellion of 1020. Imperial Navy forces took 12 years to restore order. Now under martial law, Khikaba's government is administered from the naval base at Shuka Gipdim. All development on Khikaba beyond tech level 10 is forbidden and laboratories are strictly monitored to prevent the rebuilding of high-tech weaponry. Guerilla activity is still common in mountainous areas.
