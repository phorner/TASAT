
 Settled and built up as a Base two centuries ago, Guerzim participated in the
Narman Strife. The planet served as the staging area for the forces which
invaded and occupied Narok, Tamale, and Daboya. Only disorganised remnants
survived to be evacuated back to Adrar and Guerzim. Reorganised as the
planetary defence forces, these remnants where further decimated by the
Mandanin counterattack. The refuelling base on the third moon of the outer Gas
Giant was destroyed as well as the moon itself split into four smaller
fragments. The Naval Base on Guerzim, though well defended, was destroyed also.
After the peace settlement, the devastated base was somewhat rebuilt to support
the patrol forces maintained in the sector. The troops were mostly demobilised
and settled on Guerzim. Socially they retained some of the aspects of the
former military command structure resulting in a classification of Feudal
Technocratic government. A  small Scout Base is maintained here which also
provides refuelling for the extensive patrol forces still maintained in this
region.
