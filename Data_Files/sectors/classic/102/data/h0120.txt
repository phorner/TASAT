Somewhat of a backwater planet, the 9840 kilometer diameter world is the third in the system. Two smaller airless rocks occupy the inner orbits and have only automated communications beacons on them. An outer pair of Gas Giants complete the system. A small mining station is located on one of the moons of the larger larger Gas giant. The primary products of Negril are the refined heavy metals mined here. Large quantities of special biological products are also shipped. Several popular spices are gathered from the Krasmaya species of forest shrub. It has not proved practical to cultivate this shrub so the product is obtained by gathering teams which rove in ATV's towing a processing trailer. Periodic Air Raft visits are made to collect the refined spices. The salt seas serve as a preserve or reservation for certain religious colonies of Danin which wander the shores living on large rafts. Other religious colonies live as herding Nomads on the extensive plains raising vast herds of Grazers. The seasonal ritualised confrontation between the Water Folk and the Herd People provides an occasion for trading and feasting as well as welcome entertainment to the Miners and Gatherers. Major civil administrators are appointed by the Co-Dominion Senate. Negril elects its Senator every five years and otherwise pays little attention to interstellar politics. The demand for its major products is stable. Society is quite conservative and tradition conscious. Military forces on the planet are few, consisting of a courier or two and a refuelling station. All citizens undergo a six month basic military training and then are transferred to the active reserve of the Planetary Defence Forces.
