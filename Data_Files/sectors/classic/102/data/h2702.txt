
Shang Ti is a rapidly industrialising
world. it has an unusually large population for a waterworld of its type and
has specialised in biologically produced industrial raw materials. In
cooperation with several K'kree Herd/Corporations, extensive programs of
development have been successful in finding ways of biologically developing
complex metalo-organic synthesis intermediates on a cost-competitive basis. A
traditionalist family/clan structure has provided a stable basis for an
Oligarchic government. Inter-family feuds have caused considerable turmoil in
the past, but strong repressive measures taken after an especially violent
outbreak a century and a quarter ago have proved effective. The ruling council
plans to continue its program of introducing more complex industry and
technology to make Shang Ti a major industrial centre of the Chhung Kuo.
