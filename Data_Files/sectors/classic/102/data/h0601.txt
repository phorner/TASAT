
 A relatively large sized World. The atmosphere comes close to the standard
rating, with a marginally higher oxygen content as the major difference.
Approximately 50% of the planet surface is comprised of low salt `ocean'.
The land masses are thickly covered with jungle like growth. Surprisingly, no
sentient life forms were discovered by the Survey Vessels, so little time was
wasted in establishing refineries to extract the vast petroleum deposits.
Large areas in each of the five Climate Zones have been set aside as preserves
for the indigenous life. Small portions of these reserves are in use as resorts
for travellers with a small amount of hunting permitted to the more influential
guests.
