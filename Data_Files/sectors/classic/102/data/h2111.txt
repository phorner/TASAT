
 Mining is the primary reason for Lubon's existence, though it serves secondary
functions as a refuelling stop on the border circuit. Large deposits of most
major raw materials have been discovered. A consortium of companies on Katowich
is financing development of this planet. Settlements have been started at three
major deposit concentrations and the site for an extensive Spaceport surveyed.
Roads have been established between the settlements, though it is later planned
to build monorail connections. Manufacturing and population increases are
planned to take place over the next century and a half.
