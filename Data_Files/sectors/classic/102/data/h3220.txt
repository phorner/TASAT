
 This planet is inhospitable to Human life and has little native life of its
own. That life which it does have is all desert specialised. In the dense
atmosphere, storms are frequent and fierce. A Mining Station exploits a large
deposit of rare earth minerals and a few hardy prospectors seek out and work
smaller deposits. Water is processed from hydrous minerals for life support
purposes and for fuel manufacture. Deposits are playing out and some of the
population has emigrated.
