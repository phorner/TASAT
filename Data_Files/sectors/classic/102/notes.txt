
Crucis Margin Sector - Notes and Errata
----------------------------------------

 NOTES:

The bulk of the data for the Crucis Margin Sector comes from the Judges Guild
Guidebook.

I have assigned allegiance codes since they are indicated only by symbols in
the Guidebook. I used the existing codes where possible and assigned new ones
as necessary. The new codes have not been used in other sources that I am aware
of, as far as I can ascertain.

I also generated data for planetoid belts and number of gas giants in each star
system. The Guidebook only indicates if there is a gas giant in the system, not
the number of them. With the exception of seven systems, (as noted below), I
have assigned the number of gas giants in each system that the Guidebook
indicated possessed one. I also generated the Population multiplier for this
Sector.


 ERRATA:  

There were a number of errors and inconsistencies in the original data, I have
listed all those I found and what I did about them below.

Ark Subsector - Baiti (0202)
      Sector, Subsector map and index place it at location 0202
      planet listing shows it at location 0208
      I put it at 0202 since it comes before 0204 in the listing.

Chhung Kuo Subsector -  Chu-jung (2902)
      lists UWP as B85947B4-D
      I dropped the last 4 making it B85947B-D

Olsztyn Subsector - Tarat (1311)
      Spelt as Tarrat on Subsector map
      planet listing and index spell it Tarat
      I used Tarat.

                  - planet list and index show:        Subsector map shows:
                        Kosice    (1514)                 Nowa Sol  (1514)
                        Nowa Sol  (1516)                 Gdansk    (1516)
                        Gdansk    (1518)                 Ptock     (1518)

                        Ptock     (1612)                 Kosice    (1612)
                        Gdynia    (1616)                 Suwon     (1616)
      I used the order show in the planet list.

Pingsang Subsector - Oki (0330)
      Spelt Oki in planet list and index
      Spelt Lki on Subsector map
      I used Oki

                   - Bura (0827)
      Spelt Bura in planet list and index
      Spelt Cura on Subsector map
      I used Bura      

                   - Kure (0623)
      lists UWP as A5444658-D
      I dropped one of the 4's making it A544658-D

Accra Subsector - Ngong (1124)
      lists UWP as D5778308-8
      I dropped one of the 7's making it D578308-8

Turku Subsector - Gabesh (2125)
      lists UWP as E8938887
      I placed a '-' between the 8 and 7 making it E893888-7

Andulusia Subsector - Almonte (3024)
      Spelt Almonte in planet list and index
      Spelt Amonte on Subsector map
      I used Almonte.
 
                    - Varkaus (3027)
      Spelt Varkaus in planet list and index
      Spelt Vardaus on Subsector map
      I used Varkaus.

Nigde Subsector - Tsama (1238)
      Spelt Tsama in planet list and index
      Spelt Tasama on Subsector map
      I used Tsama.

                - Stm*Fi (1632)
      Not an error but the asterisk shows as a second m - StmmFi
      I substituted the '-' character so that it now shows as Stm-Fi.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sector Map includes the profiles of 8 planetary systems, which I have
entered into the Sector. However, there are some inconsistencies in the
information as noted below :

Ark Subsector - Uaboe (0601)
      According to the profile Uaboe has a diameter of 19000 km and a
      circumference of 59660 km.
      The UWP for the Planet gives its size as 8 - 13600-15200 km 
      I left the figures out of the planet profile.

Chhung Kuo Subsector - Shang-Ti (2702)
      According to the profile, the Shang-Ti systems contains 2 gas giants
      and one Planetoid Belt.
      The planet listing in the Guidebook does not show either.
      I changed the data to show 2 Gas Giants and one Planetoid Belt.

Seven of the eight Planetary profiles contain information on the number of
Gas Giants and Planetoid Belts they possess and I have entered this into
the planet listing.

In addition some of the profiles mention the major product of the planet
and I have added these to the export category of the UWP, although in one
case the UWP indicates it shouldn't be manufacturing the product.
