40 - Usingou Sector - Credits
------------------------

The Usingou Sector data was created by John G. Wood,
except for subsectors O and P which were created by
James Kundert.

Star positions were taken (as closely as possible) from
the dot map in Vilani & Vargr, as were allegiances;
subsector names come from James Kundert.

# data mostly by John Wood (John@elvw.demon.co.uk); see his website at

# subsectors O and P by James Kundert
# removed Vazia and Tanjchiadda, which are duplicate worlds
