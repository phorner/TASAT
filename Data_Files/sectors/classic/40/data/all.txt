The Ziafrplians sector is dominated by the Zhodani Consulate. The remainder consists of worlds lying close to the Vargr Extents that the Zhodani did not claim when expanding into the sector. These are now held within the Thirz Empire, a close Vargr ally of the Consulate. Because of the relationship between the Third Empire and the Zhodani Consulate, Ziafrplians is not like other Vargr sectors.

The Vargr call it Usingou Sector and aggressive Vargr pirates know to avoid it.
