"The Assemblage of 1116 is an opportunist Vargr state formed after news 
of Strephon's assassination reached Tuglikki. Led by the dictatorial
Arruna Kosghaele Zal of Ngorsraek (1937), the Assemblage has extended 
its influence over 31 worlds in Deneb and Tuglikki sectors. Zal formed 
the Assemblage from the remains of the Erkaghodo Concordat, a political 
group that collapsed in 1083. The Concordat ruled loosely; its member 
worlds retained their freedom, although they agreed on a set form of 
federal government. Nevertheless, charismatic opposition groups caused 
the Concordat's fall seven years after its creation - a fate the 
Assemblage may yet confront.

The Assemblage is fiercely hostile to the Imperium. While Archduke 
Norris's fleets have managed to stave off many raids by independent 
corsairs, Assemblage forces have wreaked major damage on the economies 
of Lamas and Antra Subsectors. Shipping and communications in that 
region have been severely disrupted since the rise of the Assemblage 
four years ago."
