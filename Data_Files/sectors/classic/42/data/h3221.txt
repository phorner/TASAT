Ungakne (3126) and Uengtalrra (3221) are friendly industrial rivals. 
Each tries to outdo the other in terms of prosperity. When the Dzarrgh 
Federate began to grow in power during the 1090's, Ungakne joined them. 
Uengtalrra remained independent because the various nation-states could 
not come to an agreement as to whether or not membership in the 
Federate would be beneficial or not. Ungakne soon became the subsector 
capital for the Dzarrgh Federate and appears to be the more prosperous 
of the two: higher TL and better starport.
