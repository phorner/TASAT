Farrouka (1117), although owned by The People of Wanz, is completely 
under corsair control. The official word from the Wanz government is 
that the corsairs are merely safeguarding the planet that is to 
eventually be the site of a Wanz colony. The Red zoning, in addition 
to the presence of unscrupulous corsairs, is for the complete lack of 
starport facilities.
