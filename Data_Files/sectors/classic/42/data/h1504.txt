Kfok (1002) and Kfokh (1504) have caused quite a bit of confusion for 
shipping companies. Typos and verbal miscues have led to cargo 
shipments being misrouted. Each has argued that the other world should 
change its name. Kfokh had the name first and feels that Kfok should 
change. Kfok was a member of the Baknae Alliance before Kfokh and 
feels that Alliance membership should be the determining factor. 
Neither world has enough people (85 at Kfokh & 317 at Kfok) to do 
anything more than bicker.
