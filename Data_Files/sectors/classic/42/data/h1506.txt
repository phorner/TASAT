The first facility on Sosagal, Aenorz Sosagal, was built underwater 
to take advantage of the natural protection provided by the sea. 
Later on, despite upgrades to Aenorz Sosagal, growth has required 
the construction of enclosed towns and cities on the land, despite 
the thin, tainted atmosphere.
