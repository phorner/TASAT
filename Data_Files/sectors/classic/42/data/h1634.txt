Okhgug (1634) is in the midst of a world war. Although the starport is 
considered neutral territory, visitors should exercise extreme caution.
The warring factions have reduced their cities and infrastructure to 
rubble with their TL5 weaponry. They've resorted to importing weaponry 
as there is no longer a means to manufacture anything more than 
primitive weapons.
