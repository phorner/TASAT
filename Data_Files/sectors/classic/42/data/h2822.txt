Thughzkhaenghk (2822) is plagued by great sandstorms and oppressive 
heat which can wear out all but the very healthiest and heartiest of 
Vargr. The original settlements are the communities in the southern 
polar region, where the one ocean is found. Mining and then industrial 
activity brought prosperity. With the advent of cheap energy through 
fusion, climate-controlled cities have popped up in the harsher 
regions.
