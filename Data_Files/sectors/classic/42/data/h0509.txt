Raekhsva (509), although technically a water world, has many shallow 
seas which provide useful foundations for the establishment of 
low-tech artificial islands. These islands were constructed using local 
materials in 1050. Little technological progress has been made since 
then. Even the starport remains of a "bare bones" nature though this 
may change. The native sentient race, the dubbed Raekhsvans by the 
Vargr, have protested the aquatic refueling tactics of various 
starships. Although subjugate to the Vargr, they are allowed to govern 
themselves and, as such, can be considered the largest nation on this 
balkanized world. The Raekhsvans are amphibious. Trade with the Vargr 
has been mutually beneficial. Although they were only considered tech 
level 2 when the Vargr first arrived, they have since acquired enough 
knowledge from the Vargr to be treated as tech level 5.
