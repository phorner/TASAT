Zaeghzo (1804) endured a nuclear war in 1093. The weapons arsenals of
all sides involved were so thorough that very few people survived. The
starport was even destroyed. In 1100, a corsair band set up operations 
here. They trade limited amounts of equipment for food grown in the 
select few areas that aren't irradiated.
