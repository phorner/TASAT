Ilal (0136) is ruled by a draconian dictator whose regime is an 
agrarian commune. The founder of the government, Gedzoe Raedsull, 
overthrew a military regime in 1056 and instituted the current 
governmental structure which was intended to liberate the people from 
the power of the planet's "cultured elite."
