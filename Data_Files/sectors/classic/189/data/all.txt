Lying rimward of the Solomani Confederation, this sector is riddled with pocket empires, including the Amderstun Empire and the Alduwai Pairs. One subsector (Warzone Subsector)'s worlds, lying between the Amderstun Empire and the rival Chromirim Alliance, have been heavily nuked, causing almost all worlds to have exotic atmospheres, like a small version of the K'kree-G'naak Barrier.
