Keng

Keng itself is a small planet, only about 3200km in diameter. It has a standard atmosphere, but it's tainted with sulfur from the world's many active volcanoes.  Human visitors will require filter masks.
Admiral Womma Memorial Starport is a typical frontier facility with very little in terms of amenities and no significant repair facilities, but it is protected by planetside defensive weapons.  The nearest city to the starport is Womma.
The planet's surface gravity is light at 0.32G.  It takes 27.5 standard years to make one circuit around the primary, and days area 42 hours long.  The average surface temperature is a balmy 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).
Keng has a population of approximately 800 million people, which is unusual for a small frontier planet with such a low tech level.
