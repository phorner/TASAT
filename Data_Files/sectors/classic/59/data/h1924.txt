A cool climate, standard oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere world in the Lunion Subsector of the Spinward Marches. Most of Ianic's surface is windswept chilly desert without extensive mineral wealth. Overall, much of the planet is not habitable without starship-grade recycling and imports of fresh water and food. An important industry on Ianic are the isolated ranches that raise Slindi, a large warm-blooded lizard-like creature adapted to desert environments. 

Despite its harsh environment and isolated location, Ianic supports a population numbering in the millions, including a sizable number of Jonkeereen, a genetically engineered race of humans adapted for desert-world survival. Most of Ianic's population are spread out across the planetary surface in small towns supported by deep wells or natural watercourses. Normally water is shipped by a modular cutter from the asteroid belts.

The Ianic system plays an important role in the xboat network. The system is used as a storage point for xboats and their supporting tenders that are not in current service throughout the Marches, plus a number of couriers with various capabilities. 

These communications and support ships orbit one of the system's gas giants, with a central station coordinating all approaches and departures as well as acting as an accommodation center. Backups of all xboat-carried messages are maintained at Ianic's central station.
