Fulacin

Widespread taint in the form of heavy metal dust and oxides makes the atmosphere, otherwise quite ordinary, unbreathable without a filter mask.  The dust triggers allergies with great frequency, causes a wide variety of respiratory illnesses, and can cause carcinoma within years of exposure.  Great pains are necessary to keep food clean and uncontaminated; filter masks can be removed only for very short periods, such as when eating and drinking.  This metal dust has also made Fulacin an an ideal location for use of MagnetoDynamics's several patents dealing with recovery of metal from atmospheric and oceanic suspension.

A covert Zhodani operation established the class A starport through an Imperial corporation before the last war. The scheme was discovered just in time: the Zhodani almost had a base waiting for besieging Rhylanor.

In 1108, as part of the increased trust and cooperation between the Zhodani Consulate and the Imperium, the Zhodani revealed that they had established a secret base on Fulacin. It was opened up and converted into a state-of-the-art interactive museum that shows the history of the Frontier Wars from the Zhodani viewpoint. It is required visiting for any student of Frontier War history, and draws tourists from all over the Marches.
