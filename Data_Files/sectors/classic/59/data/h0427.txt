Roget

A breadbasket supplying the Darrian Confederation. 

A balkanized world, Roget was settled by large colonies of Aslan who preferred their own company and their own culture to assimiliation with humans.  Amicable meetings settle any questions involving the whole planet.  The starport was built as a joint effort.

The Confederation Archives, in the starport city of Zan Parnog, is an imposing structure consisting of five buildings, each one hundred stories high, surrounding a central core and connected by skyways at various levels  They were located here in 320 to free office space on Mire to support the Confederation Council.

Tanglewald, native to Tarsus, is found here.  It was probably imported here before the Maghiz.
