KWAI CHING              

The  Lord Leader is currently supporting one of the rival states on Singer, with the intention of securing his supply of lanthanum and exotic alloying metals.  The world is industrializing, with an  emphasis at present on military hardware for export to Singer.  Some dissident group are not pleased with this trend.  Efforts are being made to upgrade the starport.  Kwai Ching has no ships due to the lack of jump grid metals, and is currently maintaining tenuous contact with Singer by chartering two Type R merchants.
