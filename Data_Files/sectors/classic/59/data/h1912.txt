Dinomn is a Lost Colony, rediscovered and contacted in 498 after surviving the Long Night. Many ruins of the world before its decline can be seen around the planet. A fraction of the population survived the Long Night by concentrating solely on survival to the detriment of all other sensibilities. The Dinomnites are a hardy people who do not tolerate anything they see as frippery and merely decorative. Off-worlders and colonists are lumped into a single category of 'The Abandoners.'

Dinomn is government by a council made up of members of The Thousand, direct descendants of the approximately 1000 souls to survive the world's decline. Those who are not from pure blood stock of these surviving families have no say in the governance of the world. 

Note: The high CO2 content of Dinomn's atmosphere, while making it an agricultural paradise, require precautions for exposed travellers such as a filter mask or a regime of blood-acidity pills. The process of protecting offworlders to the taint is rather unpleasant, whether through acclimatization or the use of drugs. Most visitors do not alight from the starport, and conduct their business by teleconferences.

Dinomn's one major settlement is a city of the same name.
