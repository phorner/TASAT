Stellatio

Stellatio is a non-industrial Imperial world with fluid oceans, located in the Vilis Subsector of the Spinward Marches. With a total population of 50,000, most people live in Stellas, an underground city near the starport. Twenty or so smaller settlements, with dozens or hundreds of people, dot the region, along with several failed settlements, but none are more than a hundred miles from Stellas.
