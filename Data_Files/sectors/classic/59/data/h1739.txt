Aster

Aster is a potentially rich water world, which is chartered  in it's entirety to the Aster Exploitation Corporation. Two shallow seabed cities are presently under construction.  The population of about 40,000 is almost exclusively employed at this, although a number of scientific teams are scattered around the planet. - Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

Approximately 99% of the planet's surface is covered with ice, though there is just enough temperature variation to allow for isolated melting, especially at the equator.  Glisten Mineralogical operates a test mine at the north pole. All of Aster's human population is clustered around the mine in a small enclave.
