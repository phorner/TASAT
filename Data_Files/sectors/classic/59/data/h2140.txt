ROMAR
                   
The Imperial Navy base provides the livelihood for the entire population of this unpleasant little planet.  About half the population are dependents of Navy personnel, and the other half are engaged in service activities catering to Navy, Scout and Merchant personnel.  Most  food is imported, and food prices are quite high outside the subsidized Navy commissary.

The ruler of the planet is an Imperial nobleman, The Baron of Romar. For the last seventy years, this position has been in the hands of the Garol family, and the current Baron is a former Imperial Navy captain. --Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

The mainworld has a chilly climate and a thin oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, and is notable as the source of the narcotic Dustspice, much prized by the Aslan and a major cause of Aslan trans-rift migration after 380. 

Romar contains a significant Aslan population that is known to have been on-world since at least 454.
