Pixie

Imperial Prison Station 17, ex-Cruiser Gaesh, is in a restricted orbit over Pixie.  The naval base holds at least five scout/couriers at all times. 

Restricted: 
An ancient site sits on the edge of a vacuum plain under the shadow of a range of mountains. It is a flat, irregular area meticulously inlaid with a mosaic of multi-colored anodized aluminum bars.  There is no sign of the site's purpose. Numerous security devices protect it.
