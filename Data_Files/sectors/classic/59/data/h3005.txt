Aramanx

A balkanized world at the edge of the Towers Cluster. Its population is currently 1.6 billion.

Aramanx was colonized in the 400s by settlers from Junidy (Spinward Marches 3202). The initial colonists were a utopian group who attempted to eliminate warfare by returning man to a simpler state of existence. The technology required to construct fusion power plants, gravitic drives, and nuclear bombs was renounced. leaving the colonists at TL-6. 
As later generations spread out across the planet, schisms developed and war was reintroduced: gradually, under the pressures of nationalism, all of the old beliefs died except for the traditional hostility to new technology. Now even that is fading as offworld contact begins to make high technology the price of national survival, although a large segment of the population in every nation remains hostile to the new ways (and to the off worlders who bring them). 

The planet is an average sized world with a thin atmosphere; 70% of its surface is covered by water. The five major continents include a varied, but generally rugged terrain which has further encouraged the world's characteristic balkanization.

In addition to Aramanx Startown, other major settlements on Aramanx include Ginsberg, Kirshush, Uurii Town, Bachburg, Udula, and Rilagum.

Eight major and at least twenty minor countries divide the world.  Sporadic conflicts are almost constant.  While raids and border clashes occur, no nation seems willing to go over the edge into all-out war - yet. The "Powderkeg of the Towers Cluster" enjoys comparative peace, but it could easily descend into a shattering world war. 

Sternmetal supports the nation of Lovrenyi (pop 37 million.) Several nations have been forced into its sphere of influence, but an ongoing guerilla war continues in one conquest. The Republic of Lanax, on this frontline, has hired Vargr mercenaries.
