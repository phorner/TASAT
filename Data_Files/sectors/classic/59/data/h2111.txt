Djinni 

Upon arriving in-system, an automatic beacon says the system is interdicted. 

Djinni is the site of an IISS X-boat way station which is expected to be completed in late-1107. An X-boat route here links Inthe (Regina 2410) directly to Regina (Regina 1910) cutting more than three weeks off communications from Rhylanor to Regina.
