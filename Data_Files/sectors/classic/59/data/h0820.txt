Anselhome   

Claimed by both the Sword Worlds and Darrien Confederations.

A large asteroid which attracted colonists because of its wealth of ores.  Living quarters are hollowed into the rock.  
Some of the atmosphere for the underground habitats is processed from the gasses put out put out by Anselhome's volcanoes.  
The only native life (whose existence amazed some scientists) are bacteria and lichen in the low-lying valleys.
