Fornice

Settled early (about 85), Fornice was experiencing intense population pressure when the First Survey was released in 420.  To resolve land issues, it agreed to buy out the large landowners and relocate them to Tarsus.  A colony was established on Tarsus in 450, and the reseetlement was complete by 462.  This world is known to have received K'kree trade delegations in the past. K'kree visio-olfactoral art has also been known to have been traded on Fornice.
