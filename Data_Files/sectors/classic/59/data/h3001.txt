Jesedipere

A backwater world at the edge of Imperial space, Jesedipere has never been exploited, and remains a wilderness. This is largely due to the fact that the planet, a relatively young world, is still undergoing a high degree of volcanic activity. The air is tainted by varying amounts of sulfur and sulfur compounds. Thus the world has not been deemed particularly suitable for any significant degree of settlement or exploitation.

Primarily a trading post for contact with nearby Vargr worlds, in 1104 Jesedipere became a substantial refugee camp set up by Vargr fleeing from the rapid expansion of the Kforuzeng.

The town of Downport, located about 5km from the starport proper, is one of the most notoriously unrestrained dens of iniquity in the subsector, where illicit goods are regularly traded.
