Enope is a world on the edge of survival. In the sprawling underground cities that have been likened to hives or nests an enormous population lives. The surface of the planet is totally inhospitable to life and solid ground only outcrops in isolated islands separated from each other by seas of ice and dust that can be up to 4km deep. These islands are the inhabitants connection to the surface, but not one they use for any purpose other than getting on and off the planet. Much of the adult populace is employed in the extraction of metal ores from the dust seas, and as such the cities all have an industrial feel to them with noise of big machinery constant. This is not eased by the nuclear technology, which places power at a premium and miniaturisation and efficiency are at early stages of development.

Dust mining is a dangerous business, the seas are never stable and can shift with little notice. From this has grown up the Guild which now runs the planet. The Guild is a bureaucracy that ensures that all miners are protected by proper safety procedures. This philosophy has spread to every aspect of daily life and the whole system is run by "paperwork" heavy agencies that regulate every movement of people and commodities. Anything out of the normal run of affairs is often difficult to gain authorisation for.

The low gravity of Enope and the proximity of the garden world Ratope has resulted in the latter being used as a farm to supply the former. Ratope is the only place in the system where the oppressive regime can be escaped. The world is run by the Agency of Subsistence Provision, which is run by the people of Ratope for their own benefit with little intervention from Enope so long as the food shipments do not fail.
