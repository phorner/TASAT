BINGES

Binges was colonized from Glisten in 1057 by a group of  speculators hoping to build the starport and cash in.  However, their  analysis  of traffic in the region was faulty, and the port has  not  prospered.   The  planet has the dubious distinction in  recent  years  of being a flag-of-convenience homeport to a large number of disreputable 
free  traders.   (Larger companies are not free enough  from  Imperial restrictions to avail themselves of this service.)

During the Fifth Frontier War, the starport was opened to Collace fleets,  which nearly caused annexation of the planet after  the  war.  However,  the owners of the port successfully appealed their  case  in the Imperial Court at Trin, arguing that they had little choice in the face of overwhelming force.  Despite the outcome of the case,  resentment remains high among local Imperial officials at Glisten, and  more IGN ships than usual have been passing through the system. - Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

Life in a vacuum requires great discipline. After all, it only takes one forgotten seal on a vacuum suit to spell death. Those who survive tend to be very methodically-minded and attentive to small detail.
