Pavabid

Settled in the period 450-490, after the release of the First Survey. 
Establishment of a religious dictatorship in 780 led to the flight of many families.

The deeply entrenched theocracy is an offshoot of the widespread Church of the Stellar Divinity.  Potentially a rich world, its severe trade restrictions have kept its wealth and tech level lower than its neighbors.  The population of 700 million live in a stagnant, rigid society where immigration and emigration are illegal and information is strictly controlled.

Offworlders are permitted only at the Pavabid Starport and Trade Enclave. This area of four square kilometers is completely isolated from the rest of Pavabid by hundreds of kilometers of wilderness and water. It is staffed by the most loyal members of the theocracy and guarded by church troops.  The law level in the Enclave is only 8, compared to the 9 or A normal in Pavabid society.
