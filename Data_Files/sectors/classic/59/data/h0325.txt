Laberv

A hospitable world, Laberv is less populated than might be expected.  It is a major terminal for a criminal syndicate makes life a bit difficult for local industrialists.  More stubborn inhabitants have scattered into the hinterlands where this activity does not affect them.  Very little work in the starport is done by machines.  The syndicate totally controls the starport.
