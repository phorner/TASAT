Mithril

The temperature rarely goes above freezing, so the water which covers the surface is mostly ice.  Ice-caps cover both poles, and a mantle of snow and ice cover much of the continental land mass.

Mithril is listed in the directories as having no population, government, or law level; this is not entirely true. Mithril is one of the group of so-called Metal Worlds: Iron ( Sword Worlds / Spinward Marches 1626), Bronze ( Sword Worlds / Spinward Marches 1627), Steel ( Sword Worlds / Spinward Marches 1529) and Mithril. These worlds are being held in reserve by the Sword Worlds Confederation for future development. A rudimentary starport (type E, little more than an administration building next to a paved area) is maintained on-planet, along with a port warden responsible for establishing Sword Worlds sovereignty. The normal population for the world is thus closer to two or three; government is very low-profile, the local law level generally consisting of restrictions on behaviour within the administration building.
