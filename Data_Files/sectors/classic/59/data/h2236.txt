tsarina

Colonized in 697 from Glisten for exploitation of platinum group metals. The ownership of the mining company came to be controlled by three families by 726, and has remained so since. The colony is totally dependent on imports of food and equipment of up to TL9 is used, but there is no repair capability. The situation is becoming unstable at present as Glisten social activists are engaging in a propaganda campaign among the mineworkers.  The workers themselves suffer from prolonged breeding among too small a breeding stock, and have an substantially subnormal average IQ. They are also extremely superstitious, and view the three families as ruling by divine right, which has led to limited success thus far for the  Glisten social activists. "Stupid as a Tsarina miner" is a common term of phrase in the subsector.

Restrictions:  Books and other data media are severely restricted, with import duties for approved items starting at 400%  of base value and going up.
