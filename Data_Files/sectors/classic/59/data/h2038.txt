TRANE

There is a heavy reliance on orbital communications for the planetary datanet.  There is a well developed medical response system, paid for by subscription of over 95% of the population.  It is considered good manners when on Trane to offer a contribution for the  medical  service.  The primary exports are exotic organics harvested from the local fauna.  Water travel is primarily by submersible due to  the magnitude of inclement weather which can be experienced with large unbroken expanses of water.

The planet's oceans are home to a considerable variety of native life. This world contains a archaeological site with suspected high-tech remnants of the now-vanished Ancients precursor race.
