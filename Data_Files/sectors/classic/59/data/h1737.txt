EGYPT

Ministry of Colonization training and test facility and naval base. The naval base is an orbital facility. The permanent population is around 500,000, with an additional 100,000 transients at any given time.  Nearly all of the permanent inhabitants are employees of the bases. The tech level refers to local manufactures, as most necessary equipment is imported from Glisten. - Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

Until 940, the Glisten subsector was an isolated spur of the Imperial X-Boat network and a backwater for marginal officials of the Imperial bureaucracy. In 941, District 268 was opened by decree of Margaret II and the Glisten subsector has since served as a base for the colonization and integration of the new territory.

The planet’s population is solely dependent upon its status as a research station and a colonization waypoint, all entirely owned and managed by the Imperial Ministry of Colonization. Various environmental domes contains the different environments that colonists might encounter. 

There are only a few hundred Jonkeereen on Egypt, and they are solely involved with scientific studies, mostly on the suitability of their species for various planets. Sometimes relations between scientists and Jonkeereen become a bit strained because of the Jonkereen’s history with the Ministry. Most of these Jonkeereen originate on Melior/Glisten (Spinward Marches 1736), though a few are born on Egypt as well.
