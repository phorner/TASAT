Forine

An industrial world producing electronics components. 

High population, industrialized world in District 268.  Forine is the primary producer of processed and refined metals and minerals for the subsector.  Forine itself is a small, bitterly cold (average surface temperature is -146 C) planet with a trace atmosphere and no native lifeforms of any kind. Its surface is dotted with huge environmental domes that provide the one thing that's not available in the space habitats elsewhere in the system: space. The domes are so densely and so evenly distributed that the nightside viewed from space gives the illusion that the entire surface is covered by a single structure.
