Dhian

A very repressive government maintains itself through monopolizing production of oxygen and food. It restricts technology to very low levels to safeguard its monopolies.  All plants are grown with hydroponics in government-owned farm complexes.  Tukera Lines and Oberlindes Lines, a local firm, are competing. 

Oberlindes Lines and Tukera Lines, attracted by the X-boat terminus are competing for shipping and passengers to nearby and predominantly coreward high population worlds. (Wochiers, Algine, Rethe, Inthe, Treece). Tukera's interest stops at these worlds, as a megacorporation, preferring to stay close to the X-boat route. Whilst Oberlindes continues to service high pop worlds and class C plus starports throughout Aramis and Regina sub-sectors. 

Dhian is the Subsector headquarters of Imperiallines. 

Imperiallines tramp traders maintain an office providing feeder routes to 16 secondary systems (class C starports or less) within 4 parsecs (Focaline or Violante via Paya). J1 and J2 tramp freighters provide the workhorses. Service can be irregular, but will often adapt to the needs of specific clients.

In addition to Dhian Startown, the other major settlement on Dhian is Hushkim Town.
