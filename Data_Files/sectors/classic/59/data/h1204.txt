Mongo

Mongo is a small world that is covered mostly with water.  Mongo is a nonindustrial, rich, agricultural world with improving living conditions due to a bustling agro-economy. As an agricultural world, this world is a near-ideal environment for producing quality foodstuffs of plant, animal, and other forms. Quality foodstuffs are a major export commodity for this world.  It requires extensive imports of outside technology to maintain a modern, star-faring society. Having to import most manufactured and high tech goods drives the price up for these items at this world. Its economy is bustling and an increase in living conditions is expected in the near future. It is a member of the Third Imperium in the Jewell Subsector of Spinward Marches Sector in the Domain of Deneb.

This world has a nearby Imperial Naval Base, capable of handling warships. It also contains an Imperial Scout Base, capable of handling IISS starships and personnel.

Mongo is a part of the Jewell Cluster.
