Bendor

Bendor is about as nice a place as you can imagine. Except for the thin atmosphere, the planet is extremely earth-like. The  population is small, and the Marquis likes it that way.  No immigration is permitted, but visitors are welcome. Much of the planet's agricultural activity is automated, with robotics mostly being imported from Glisten.  Bendor is a favorite vacation spot in the region, and hotels are very common in a variety of settings from mountains to shore and from temperate to tropical.  Since it is ruled directly by an Imperial noble, cooperation with the Navy base is good, and there is little friction.

Unusual exports include karakka nuts (native to the planet and impossible to cultivate in quantity elsewhere), a variety of perfumes, and a number of excellent wines with a lot of snob appeal.  These latter can be found for export occasionally (Formidable, Trader, 1 day, success produces 3d6 bottles at 2d6*50 credits each).
