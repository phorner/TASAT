LYDIA

TL6 is barely sufficient to maintain the colony domes in the trace atmosphere. Formerly a mining colony founded to exploit massive quantities of silver, it has been on the decline since the silver gave out around 1020.  ConTech closed the starport in 1035, and most of the population emigrated.  The remainder are expert garbage pickers--a fair amount of useful salvage at TL12 remains from the mining operation, enough that free traders occasionally call to pick up the junk. - Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

The whole population of Lydia live in a single natural cavern, surviving on hand-made life support machinery.
