Yres, once a proud monarchy ruled directly by the Marquis von Talbot, was reduced to anarchy after the 4th Frontier War. Although, the war was won, the Marquis was killed, and the planet broke out into rebellion against the ruling family. After two decades of police action on Yres, the Imperium has broken the revolutionary movement and established two rival governments on the world: The Wonderful Community, a religious dictatorship with strict moral codes, and the YLU (Yresian Liberty Union), a charismatic dictatorship ruled by popular conservative, Arthur Kuzumi.

The starport, nested in the small neutral zone between the two nations, displays the Imperium's indifference between the two rival governments. Since the revolution, the household of von Talbot relocated to Menorb and has been elevated in status to the seat of the 8th County of Regina.

The world's 34 million inhabitants, as divided as they are, can no longer instill rebellion for fear of being crushed by each other. However, neither can they choose a productive course for the world. This social conflict, as deadly as the corrosive atmosphere of the world, has created a climate of fear and desperation, where large-scale sabotage in the vast underground cities is commonplace. It is even rumored by high-level sources that TAS is currently in deliberation with the rival governments over whether or not to classify the planet as an amber zone.
