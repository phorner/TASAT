Rethe

Rethe has both a very thin almost non-existent atmosphere and no surface water which makes habitation by sophonts difficult.
In addition to Rethe Startown, other major settlements on Rethe include Khidabra, Klu City, Ursaka, Gashi, Kanala, Eudukate, Mead, and Usheme.


Festival of Rethe
-----------------
Annual celebration of the colony on Rethe. Originally a reaction to the restrictive governmental structure considered necessary for survival on Rethe , the three day holiday period has continued as a carefree celebration where citizens release the tension that has built up over the year. All laws are suspended, with law level becoming 0 during the celebrations. Some abuses have always been persistent, but the population has always resisted any effort to change the conditions of their favorite holiday.

The Travellers' Aid Society has classified Rethe as an Amber Travel Zone during the period of the Festival. During the six-day Festival, law level is reduced to zero and the world is posted as an amber zone.
