Aramis

Aramis is recovering from a long period of internecine conflict that resulted in an exchange of nuclear strikes. While the environmental damage was limited, popular opinion has turned against violence of any sort and embraced a radical program of global disarmament.

In addition to being a small industrial fief on long-term lease to Peabody Instrument, Aramis has several coastal enclaves on the only moderately large continent of the planet, and a large outback, thinly populated with no government. 'Clave Detmender inspires the outbackers to increase their raids on several other enclaves. 'Clave Belcherfus hired a cadre.
