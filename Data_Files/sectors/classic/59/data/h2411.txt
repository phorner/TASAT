Keanou

Keanou is a cold, harsh world of rocky desert and mountains swept by bitter winds. Keanou has a tainted, unbreatheable atmosphere and little available surface water.

This desert world is a source of dustspice, a powerful seasoning with mild euphoric properties.  It is rarely available in quantity.
