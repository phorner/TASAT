L'oeul d'Dieu

The mainworld is under the aegis of Sharurshid, a MegaCorporation specializing in rare trade goods. Sharurshid obtains a variety of exotic seafoods and other products from this world. There has been much pressure to have the world opened up for settlement, but Sharurshid, fearing damage to the local ecosystem, has resisted. The Starport on a small sea tower is the only planetary area where non-employees are allowed.

Naasirka has a transport line offices on this world.
