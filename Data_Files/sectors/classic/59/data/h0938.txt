INCHIN                 

Inchin is occupied by a small group of military personnel from Avastan.
8000 people inhabit the one underground complex, and operate mining and pharmaceutical production facilities.
All mine output is reserved for use by the Avastan government, but there is some export of pharmaceuticals.
Almost all equipment is imported.
