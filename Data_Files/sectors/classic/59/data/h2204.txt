Beck's World   

This is a backwater world near the coreward end of Regina Subsector. Beck's world is rigidly controlled by a paramilitary state. The planet's population is concentrated in and around a single settlement, Beck's Town, located on the shore of the world's one small sea. 

A repressive government and limited trade have both served to keep the Tech Level of this world very low. Beck's World has two claims to Fame. One is the fact that there is an ancient site on the world, which is being excavated by the University of Regina. The University has only partially excavated this collapsed warren of interlocking caverns. 

The other major claim to fame is the Battle of Beck's World, which happened on 122-1109 during the Fifth Frontier War. In that battle, Admiral Elphinstone destroyed the last remnants of the Vargr fleet from Yorbund (Spinward Marches 2303). This major victory was instrumental in breaking the Vargr resolve and eventually winning the war. 

What many people do not know is that the Vargr prisoners from that battle were quartered on Beck's World until after the war. Many of the Vargr chose to remain on Beck's World after they were released, and have since become Imperial citizens. About one third of the planet's population now is Vargr. The prison camp where they were held was torn down as a gesture of friendship between the two races. 

Colonized in 228 as Frisini, Beck's World was a crucial battlefield in the Civil War, finally falling to a pro-Imperial mercenary regiment. Beck's Bruins, under Colonel Vilna Beck, stayed after the war, rewarded with land grants on their conquest.  The planet's name was changed to Beck's World.
