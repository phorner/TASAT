Condyole is a non-industrial world located near the Vargr Extents in the Jewell Subsector of the Spinward Marches. Although Non-Aligned, the system's location behind the Riverland Wall gives the Zhodani Consulate more access than the Third Imperium. 
The planet is a hellworld with fluid oceans, and homeworld to the Vexx minor race. Due to the inhospitable atmosphere, the population of Condyole are crowded into underground habitats and sealed surface modules.
