Cunnonic   

One of the less hospitable worlds which Darrian settlers colonized.  Cunnonic's climate is cool but tolerable.  Its many volcanoes are violently active on the average of at least once a year and cause earthquakes and tsunamis.  By far the biggest obstacle to colonization was the presence of hostile native life.  Large predators of several types ranged the one large continent, and poisonous trappers were common in thearchipelagoes.  Much smaller herbivores ruined many crops before effective detterents for them were found.  All in all, a very Earth-like planet to conquer for a people who had lived on a tame planet like Darrian.  Perhaps because so many of the colonists were Solomani (who were used to such worlds), the planet's government split into eight factions.  A higher tech level would be possible if these various factions would cooperate (espoecially on their starport), but that seems unlikely.  Fortunately, these various groups rarely resort to outright warfare to settle their differences.

Tanglewald, native to Tarsus, is found here.  It was probably imported here before the Maghiz.

The planet Cunnonic orbits a dim class M0 main sequence star located in the Daryen (Darrian) subsector of the Spinward Marches. 

The remainder of the system contains two gas giants and four other planets. There are no significant planetoid belts in the system. 

The planet Cunnonic is unusual in that its speed of rotation is much higher than current theories on planetary formation would allow for. Amongst the explanations put forward to explain this are that the ancients altered the worlds rotation, or that an encounter with a passing body altered it. No evidence for either theory has thus far been found.
