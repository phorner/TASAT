Spume 
The Darrian government substantially improved this world as a military base for defense against possible Sword World invasions. 

A Confederation world, Spume, like Anselhome, was colonized for resources rather than comfort.  Its atmosphere is polluted with radioactive gasses from its few volcanoes.  All inhabitants live in Dryavis, a domed village from which mining machines are directed by remote systems.  These machines sometimes refuel at a lake near the village.
