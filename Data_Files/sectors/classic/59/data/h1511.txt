Tionale

A non-industrial system outside the sphere of direct Imperial influence, although considered a client state. The world's tainted atmosphere and lack of any readily exploitable resources caused it to be settled recently, compared to its neighbors.  Settlement still clusters around the starport, but a slowly expanding belt of farms and small settlements surrounds the port city.  A little studied alien race, originally peaceful, inhabit the extensive outback.
