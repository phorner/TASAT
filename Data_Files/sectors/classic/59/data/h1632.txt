MILAGRO

Originally a Forine penal colony, settled around 750.  Contact ceased some 40 years later, when the lanthanum mines were exhausted.  The present colony consists of descendants of the original prisoners, in a number of underground cities. The planet is fairly self sufficient, although  97% of the food supply consists of cultured yeast products.  As a result, natural food is in high demand, and there  are no import duties on it.  The government assesses a 1% transaction tax on all other activities by offworld merchants. - Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

Milagro is a decidedly unpleasant planet that seems undeserving of its name -- which translates as “Miracle” in an ancient Solomani language and likely hearkens back to an unrecorded incident of survival against the odds during the earliest exploration of the system. The planet has low gravity (0.26G), only a trace atmosphere, and very little water -- all of it in solid form thanks to the average surface temperature of -25°C
