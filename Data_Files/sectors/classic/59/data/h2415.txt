Vreibefger

Vreibefger has a frozen climate and a dense oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. 

The icebear is a native species of Vreibefger and is hunted for its fur.

The Research Station Epsilon is located at a remote site on-planet, in the crater of an extinct volcano in the Molars, a peculiarly squared-off mountain range. It is engaged in stock breeding experiments, as part of a long range project to improve several of the Imperium's meat producing animals.
