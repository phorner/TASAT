CENTRY

An abandoned mining colony.  The remaining inhabitants live in the abandoned company buildings and come to town  for parts  to keep their respirators running.   All operating vehicles are left over from the mining operations.  There is little or no  contact with other worlds, except for a visit from the occasional free trader.  Population is about 20,000.
