Zila

Prior to the Fifth Frontier War the IISS established a minor trading station at Zila to encourage commerce with the neighboring Vargr. In addition to Zila Startown, other major settlements on Zila include Suugadus, Dirniga, and Irkigaki. 
Zila is world famous for its wines. Recent vintages have been noted throughout the Marches for their quality.
