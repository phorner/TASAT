A large, close moon, a high axial tilt, and an energetic sun combine to produce giant tides and extreme weather effects.  A very large and nasty predator, the 'byssal' is the source of an anti-inflammation drug which has so far defied economical synthesis.

The population is primarily occupied with chasing down these 40,000 kilogram swimming carnivore/killers, and excising the gland in which the drug is concentrated.  Each gland yields about 5 kilograms of raw drug.  The byssal regenerates the gland in about a year, and can be harvested many times.  The hunters operate in small crews aboard specially designed submersibles.  Much skill is involved in searching for the predator in the ocean depths; the actual capture process is short but dangerous.

The worlds hosts a Oberlindes Lines Trade Station and offices from Tukera Lines.
