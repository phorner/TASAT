Patinir

Dominated by a large gas giant, the system has only a few small planets and satellites, all of little importance. Circling the central star, however, is a broad asteroid belt that is the primary source of mineral wealth in the system. In orbit ahead of, as well as trailing, the gas giant are accumulations of asteroids at the Trojan points. These Trojan points are each the site of a self-contained space colony of about 480,000 persons population. Effectively identical, the space colonies each operate a refinery smelter, which processes are taken from the larger asteroid belt which orbits starward of the gas giant.

Imperiallines maintains facilities at the starport.
