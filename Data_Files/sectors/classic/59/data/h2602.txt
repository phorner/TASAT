Corfu

Interdicted as a quarantine measure.  In 1062 Corfu's population was stricken with a virulent pathogen known as the Corfu Claw Virus. While not possessing a high lethality rate, the disease was quite debilitating to its sufferers and has since infected 5% of the population.  No cure is yet known, although some treatments have relieved some of the effects. The IISS and Rhylanor University are working to find a cure.
