Quiru

Quiru is the largest moon of the gas giant Plistii. A regular stopover on the Spinward Main, Quiru is overshadowed by nearby Heroni.

Quiru contains a small mining colony and acts the headquarters for the small shipping company MainLines. Quiru's greatest draw is its reputation as a free port, "where anything can be had at a price." 

Governed by a military junta placed in power by a small mercenary army.  The Imperium tolerates the junta, because it replaced a government that was less efficient.
