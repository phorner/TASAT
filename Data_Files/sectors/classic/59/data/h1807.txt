Knorbes

The lesser continent is an Imperial Game Preserve under the nominal supervision of the Ministry of Conservation.  Entry into the preserve is strictly controlled and, even with permits, is allowed only onto the northern shore in the company of a licensed guide.

RESTRICTED: The southern region of the lesser continent is an archeological site excavating an Ancient site. A pinnace flew close surveillance, while a ship in stationary and silent orbit provides site security.

A large cache of black globe generators found here were of special interest: the navy has made this a major excavation project. The Ancient base was destroyed when a massive attack cratered the area, and then toppled mountains into the craters. Erosion has uncovered ruined brick and mortar buildings.
