FFUDN

The colony was founded from Glisten in 726 when exploitable quantities of superheavy elements were discovered. The current bureaucratic administration is a direct descendent of the Glisten MinCol Department which was responsible for the planet prior to the declaration of independence in 877.  In the early 900's, the population was almost completely converted to Khargin, a stoic and introspective religion of Vilani origin.  The population increased drastically and the technological level fell off as more of the planet's resources were turned to maintaining subsistence. At present, offworld visitors are restricted to  the vicinity of the starport, and the population is closely controlled because of the scarcity of resources.

Imports of food are duty free, and generally can be sold for 10-30% over the expected value.  (20-40% if the trader is willing to take  payment in barter).  Exports are radioactives (restricted to holders of Glisten MinTrade licenses) and heavy metals.
