Algine

Algine is an exceptionally hospitable world, which is why it was settled twice during the Long Night, by Vilani around -2200 and by Solomani around -1000. Both groups of settlers lost their technology, but otherwise prospered. The world was put under interdict by the Scouts to protect its nascent civilizations. Rumor has it that the Scouts are currently evaluating Algine with a view to lifting the interdict. 

A naval task force will allow refuelling from a gas giant, but will not allow landing on the world.
