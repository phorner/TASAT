Rech

Rech is a world with vast flatlands and is a prime agricultural world known throughout the Marches for its smoked meats and fine leathers. Its two moons, Khalil and Monil, are small worlds in their own right with significant bodies of water and human-standard atmospheres. All three worlds comprise the core of the "Lanth Breadbasket" which helps feed this entire region of the Spinward Marches.  The turbulent atmosphere spawns tornadoes on a regular basis, and the high oxygen content is poisonous to humans and poses a severe fire hazard.  

In addition to Rech Startown, other major settlements include Aaski and Blake's Town. 

Rech has a decent highport, and a serviceable downport, but due to the harsh atmospheric conditions, ships must have special permits (and a special streamlining configuration) to land on the planet. Most of Rech Startown consists of subterranean starship berths accessible by elevator.
