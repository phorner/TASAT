Louzy

Louzy is a poor, non-agricultural and industrial high-population hellworld with a billion or more sophonts in size who still struggle to survive in an inhospitable environment. It is unable to produce quality foodstuffs and must import them. As an industrial world, this planet has well-developed manufacturing and processing industries. Manufactured goods are a major export item. It is a member of the Third Imperium in the Jewell Subsector of Spinward Marches Sector in the Domain of Deneb.

The planet had enormous natural mineral reserves, and during the 600s Louzy saw a huge boom in ore mining and processing that drew the attention of several megacorps, including Sternmetal Horizons. During the 700s Louzy saw the end of the easily-accessible deposits and experienced a global economic depression that took centuries to shake off. 

Today, the Louzy economy is strictly-regulated by the world government but stable. A modest mid-tech industrial base exports raw materials and an increasing amount of finished goods through the formerly extensive starport.
