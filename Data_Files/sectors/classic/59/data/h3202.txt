Junidy

The most populous world in Aramis subsector.

Homeworld of the Llellewyloly: a race whose five limbs function as both hands and feet.  They have a complex society with many dimensions of social precedence; the same individual may be entitled to high status in one situation and low status in another, and to make an error in propriety is a serious matter.

They have five multi-jointed limbs which serve as hands and feet interchangeably. Their main sensory organs are also located on the limbs. Long, course hair covers their spherical, central bodies. Physiologically, they are adapted to Junidy's daily temperature extremes.

Llellewyloly society is filled with subtle complexities. A being's social status is always in flux, from one situation to the next, and to make an error in propriety is a serious matter. Their tech level 3 society is non-starfaring.
