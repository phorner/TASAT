Retinae

The Imperium established a research station in the Retinae system in 556, RsDelta; the system was part of the Imperium then.  The Imperium maintains the station despite relinquishing the system (and all other possessions in the subsector) in 986. It has frequently figured in Zhodani diplomatic protests. It is supplied from Frenzie/Vilis through Thanber.
