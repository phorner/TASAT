Wardn

A small world noted primarily for intricate patterns carved in its desert plains.  One hypothesis holds that the runes are marks left by anaerobic life, while another claims that they are artifact results of an ancient culture.

The deserts are decorated by large-scale patterns carved by anaerobic life forms during their seasonal migrations.  Some academics researching this phenomena feel the patterns are expressions of intelligence.
