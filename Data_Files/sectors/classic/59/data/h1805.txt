Uakye

This is tidally locked world.  Fortunately, most of the land surface is along the twilight zone.

On the largest island, Triante, Uakye City lies on the northern shore (toward the dark side.) Directly north of Uakye City is the Shallows, a large expanse of ocean barely more than a meter deep.  An abandoned military base sits on the eastern edge of the island.

The island of Linradis, small and isolated, lies several hundred kilometers north of Uakye, deep in the world's dark side.  Roughly halfway between is Staging Point, a remote island outpost for treavellers between the two places.  Even farther north, in the center of the dark hemisphere, is Mining Colony 78, situated under a large icecap.

In an effort to increase Uakye's population, the government requires widows and widowers between the ages of 20 and 30 to remarry within a year. Divorces are not allowed between these age limits. 

Directly north (toward the dark side) of Uakye City is an area of ocean known as the Shallows, because of its consistent depth of about one meter, covering about 40,000 square kilometers. Every two years, the "Race to the Depths" pits the hardiest Uakyeans against each other as teams of four citizens compete in an "overland" trek. Starting from Uakye City, each team must travel, on foot, 220 kilometers due north to reach the edge of the Shallows, where the continental shelf suddenly drops off. The winning team (or team member, in case of casualties from drowning or attacking ocean life), is awarded a cash prize of Cr50,000; the potential income from commercial endorsements is valued at about five times that amount.
