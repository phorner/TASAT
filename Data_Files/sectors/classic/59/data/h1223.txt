Gram

Capital of Sword Worlds Confederation.
This is the only high-pop, class A starport in the Confederation.
Gram was the first of the Sword Worlds to be settled. The world was sufficiently habitable to allow the colonists to establish a home and then spread out to what became the other Sword Worlds as their numbers grew. For this reason the people of Gram have always considered themselves the original and best Sword Worlders, and of course the rightful leaders of the Confederation. Gram has been at least the nominal capital of the Confederation since 852. 

Gram produces most of the warships used throughout the Confederation. Conditions in Gram's industrial cities are rather grim, with unrest common among the workers.

Gram has an orbital military base. The original was was badly battered in the last days of the Fifth Frontier War, and a new one was constructed following the war.
