Lablon

An agricultural world whose economy is supported mostly by selling agricultural products to the Vargr through the trading station. The population of 500,000 live in small farming towns scattered about the most fertile areas of the four continents. The government, the Lablon Planetary Cartel, is mainly responsible for insuring that no community exports for other than the legally set price: since the prices are high, there is little resistance.

Lablon was not settled until nearly 600 and remains lightly populated. The world lies at the very edge of the subsector; its economy is supported mostly by the sale of agricultural produce through a local Trade Station, operated by the Scout Service to promote trade with the neighboring Vargr.

Oberlindes Lines, Akerut, and numerous Vargr trading organizations all maintain offices on Lablon.
