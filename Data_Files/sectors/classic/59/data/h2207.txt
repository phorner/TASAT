Wochiers

The planetary atmosphere makes surface travel difficult and dangerous.  The high atmospheric pressure greatly facilitates crystal-growing, which is the planet's main industry. Wochiers crystals are very durable and are used primarily in Imperial warships. The population lives in the mountains or in underground complexes.By tradition, all visitors to Wochiers must bring an offering of a living plant to the hydroponics caves; suitable plants are available in the starport gift shop. In addition to Wochiers Startown, other major settlements on Wochiers include Rouseau, Ginush, Gagamburg, and Kumaland. In 499 the Octagon Society dissolved after financial scandals; most assets were sold at auction, and the remainder transferred to Wochiers.
