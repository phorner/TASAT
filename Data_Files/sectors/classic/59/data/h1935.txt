WINDSOR

Windsor was originally discovered, claimed, and developed by the Exploration Division of the Al Morai merchant line during the Third Century. The world was subsequently sold to Ling-Standard Products.  As a nonindustrial world, it requires extensive imports of outside technology to maintain a modern, star-faring society. The need to import most manufactured and high technology goods drives the price of these goods up in the open market.  It has high-grade living conditions and life on this world is much admired by off-worlders.  10% of the world's population is the Major Race Aslan.

Windsor orbits the gas giant Vintii, which is itself unusual in being very close to the system's primary, a K9 star. Vintii is itself almost a brown dwarf, and emits enough heat to give Windsor a hot climate.
