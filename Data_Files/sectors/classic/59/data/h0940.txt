SINGER

The mainworld is split between four main governments and several minor ones.  The populations cluster around the sea shores, and  there are vast tracts of desert in the hinterlands.  One government is being supported  by Kwai Ching, and is presently gaining ascendancy despite an alliance by the other three powers due to the importation of TL10 weaponry. Some local production of TL7 weapons is being undertaken by this state, and the presence of Kwai Ching advisors is commonplace.
