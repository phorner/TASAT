Shirene

Al Morai merchant line owns this world, and has an overhaul and maintenance facility for its fleet of ships. It operates at full capacity, overhauling one ship every two weeks. The world was originally discovered, claimed, and developed by the Exploration Division of Al Morai to supplement its cargo carriers, and Al Morai continues to use Shirene as a base of operations and a source of merchant goods. Large tracts of undeveloped land are reserved for outdoor recreation for the ship crews.
