Violante

A consortium of wealthy nobles from Deneb sector invested in an unspoiled wilderness when they foresaw a time when the Imperium's spinward regions would be heavily populated. They parcelled the world into estates with strict controls on population and land use. The population consists of landowners and their families (ancestors of the purchasers, 30% of whom live elsewhere for part of the year), supervisory staff, servants, and technicians.

Violante has a short-sleeve breathable atmosphere.  This world designated as an Amber Zone. Caution is advised since the world has an environment, laws, customs, life forms, or other conditions that are not well understood and might be a danger to a visitor.

100% of the world's population is the Major Race Vargr.
