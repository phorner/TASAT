Lunion

The LSP shipyard here, along with Strouden, is one of the major shipbuilding points within the Spinward Marches. Excellent workmanship and level D technology make its products sought after. The LSP shipyards at Lunion and Strouden are two of the largest producers of starship hulls in the Marches. They specialize in warships for the Imperial Navy.  Lunion serves as the crossroads of commerce and information to Glisten (Spinward Marches 2036) and beyond, as well as the Border Worlds. As a major trade hub several Megacorporations and numerous smaller companies have offices located in the starport.
