Winston

Claimed by both the Sword Worlds and Darrian Confederations.

Winston was only thinly colonized before it was taken over and lost a great deal of its population and technology in repeated fighting with the Sword Worlds.  Some nations are still sympathetic to the Sword Worlds, but most are loyal to Darrian.
