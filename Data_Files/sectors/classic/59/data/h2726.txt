Carey

Carey has a warm climate and a standard oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere tainted by airborne spores. Carey's ecosystem is dominated by a vast array of fungus-like life that blanket the world's small land surface, giving the ground a weirdly alien look. The growths also somehow manage to invade dwellings and the downport despite the best efforts to keep them out. Visitors returning to the highport are required to undergo decontamination procedures before entry to avoid off-world contamination.

The merchant line Al Morai has established facilities at the Carey starport in order to keep its routes open for their full length. This installation supplies refined fuel for Al Morai ships and provide all of the capabilities that are present at other Al Morai installations. The fuel and repair facilities are exclusively for the use of Al Morai, and effectively upgrade the class C starport to class B for Al Morai ships.
