Zyra

The original survey report showed only low levels of potentially exploitable minerals. Lacking the equipment and know-how to mine these deposits economically, the Zyrans sought outside help. The interstellar firm of Telneskian Mines & Refining agreed to provide training for the locals in return for a significant share of any profits.
 
Recent information indicates that the original report was inaccurate, and the lesser continents hold many rich and readily exploitable metallic lodes. The Zyran Confederacy believes that the company will soon move to take over control of the government of Zyra to drain the world of its resources. 

Located within the Katarulu Cluster and orbiting the largest gas giant of that system (Bellus), Zyra's 60,000 inhabitants concentrate around two harbor cities on the eastern coast of the largest continent.
