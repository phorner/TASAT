Carsten

A lawless, mining world whose major resource is radioactive ores.  Ore is found in small pockets near the surface.  Large-scale mining is not economical, but a population of independent miners makes a good living.  Carsten has a very cold climate and a very thin oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere tainted by low oxygen levels.
