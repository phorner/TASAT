Bael

Bael is a small vacuum planet, not too different to a dozen or so similar moons and planets in the Bael system, and millions of others across known space. It is located beyond the Imperial border in an isolated system within the Querion subsector, three parsecs from any other system and second parsecs from the Foreven sector. A few intrepid souls, prospectors and wildcat miners, have tried their hand in the Bael system over the years. They have had just enough success to keep less than a hundred of them prospecting and scratching a living, but never finding a sufficiently interesting lode to attract any more wildcatters, much less a major corporation.
