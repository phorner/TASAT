Turedad

Long a sleepy, agricultural world depending on passing free traders to provide markets for its goods, Tureded is an agricultural world with an ideal environment for producing food from plants, animals, or other forms. There are four starports at Turedad, situated equidistant along the equator.  Each has full facilities for a class-C starport. 

Prior to the Fifth Frontier War Tureded was viewed as having increasing importance as a trade and shipping center because of its location at a junction for jump-1 travel from rimward to the Regina, Jewell, and Rhylanor subsectors. Tureded was widely expected to be upgraded to a class B Starport and the Scout Service was negotiating the establishment of a Scout Base, with the apparent intention of an X-Boat link from Rhylanor (Spinward Marches 2716) to Dinomn (Spinward Marches 1912) and Regina (Spinward Marches 1705). However, the independent nature of the locals, who were not keen on an influx of offworlders, delayed expansion of the starport and negotiations over the base, and as the Fifth Frontier War broke out negotiations were broken off.
