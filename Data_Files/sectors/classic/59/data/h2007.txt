Roup

A small, water-covered world on the xboat route through Regina subsector.  Its history is one of strict controls by a cruel but fair dictator, the Leader.  The population distribution on Roup is the reason for these controls: all of its billions of people live huddled in cities built on the peaks of an underwater mountain range, the only dry land masses on the entire planet.  In addition to Roup Startown, other major settlements on Roup include Renoir, Lurka, Rudun, Ishakema, Lameburg, and Shikii City.

The entire planet suffers from the symptoms of massive overpopulation, i.e. crowding, disease, and massive food demands.  Because of the strain an offworlder population would cause on Roup's economy and because of the often vicious nature of life there, Roup has been posted an Amber Zone.  Only a tiny scout base is kept there to maintain the xboat route.

Roup's entire industry is geared to killing the plentiful sea life and processing it into food concentrates to feed its population. The concentrates, Roup's only food source, are used as emergency rations by Regina's subsector navy.  Roup’s citizens practice aquaculture on a planetary scale, with whole oceans sectioned off using bubblenets to maximize productivity.

Roup stands at tech level 7, hampered by its tainted atmosphere and its people's needs.  They prize two things above all else: living space (most live in the streets) and real food.

An Al Morai facility supplies fuel and repair facilities for Al Morai ships, making this a class B starport for those ships.

The Tukera family maintains a villa on the island of Lurka as well as dockside and cargo rights for regular route cargo and liner visits to Roup.
