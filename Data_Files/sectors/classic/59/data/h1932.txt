MITHRAS

Imperial Prison. Not really too bad a place, Mithracity is underground and the guards do little but keeps brawls down to a minimum.  
The planet is a killer, and cooperation is expected of and respected by the inhabitants.  No outgoing emigration.

Convicted criminals deported here begin life anew.  Although environmental conditions are harsh, the opportunities available have made it a showcase of rehabilitation.
