Thisbe 

A long-term project diverts large numbers of frozen water and gas asteroids from the Thisben Belt to the planetary surface. The intention is to improve the atmosphere and hydrosphere percentages. 

A desert world being terraformed by the megacorporation Sharurshid under a contract from the Ministry of Colonization.  Ice and frozen gas asteroids are maneuvered from the planetoid belts to Thisbe, where they improve water availability and atmosphere content.

Thisbe is ruled by the latest in a long line of dictators, but the population seems content with their rigidly controlled lifestyle, which at least provides security. Despite the heavy hand of law, the Thisbans are currently undergoing a poetic and artistic renaissance.
