Yebab

Yebab is a large, chilly world with an exotic atmosphere composed of methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and various trace elements. 

Yebab's highly alien ecology makes the world of particular interest for scientific research. The University of Regina's biology department maintains a research facility at Yebab's starport to study the world's many exotic lifeforms.

Yebab is also the homeworld of the Ebokin, a minor race with an extremely conservative, matriarchal society; its members rarely leave their planet. The Ebokin are an octapedal (8-peds) race of insectoids. They are chilopodoids and bear a base similarity to the Terran centipede and related organisms.
