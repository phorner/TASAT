Pysadi

Pysadi is also the sole environment of the Anolas, a hermaphroditic prosimian analog (similar in performance and function to member of the Terran genus Platypoecilus). Anolas are "naturally" considered holy by the Mother Church, and their capture, study, or export is prohibited. Killing one is a capital offense. 

Ruled by a religious dictatorship, the "Mother Church." This faith worships the world Pysadi itself, believing Pysadi to be the mother of all things (much like the Terran Gaia movement of the -2500's).  

Offworld, Pysadi is renowned for its fruit. Fresh (and preserved) fruit from Pysadi is esteemed (and accordingly priced) throughout the Domain. In fact, Pysadian fruit is one of the few agricultural commodities that is actually shipped in low berths to preserve its freshness. Notable Pysadian fruit include skymelon and trake. Trake grown on Pysadi produces much better trake wine (called atrake) than that from trake grown elsewhere, but alcohol is forbidden by the Mother Church, making the production of Pysadian atrake a difficult proposition.

Anola were determined to be psionic, but not intelligent, sometime after 508.
