MERTACTOR

A token capital for District 268 is maintained here, although Imperial affairs are administered from Glisten.                

Mertactor is a low gravity planet with a dense atmosphere, and as a result much of the animal life has evolved into flyers of one sort or another.  Human powered flight is a popular leisure activity.  Most of the planet's water is scattered in small seas and large lakes rather than being concentrated in larger oceans.  The human population has adapted to this by colonizing in small towns around the shores, and this has led to a tendency for the culture of the planet to be considered rather boring by its neighbors.  About 10% of the population is Aslan, descended from a group of mercenaries employed by the Imperium around  950.  They are pretty thoroughly assimilated, although their presence does attract attention from Aslan long range traders. -Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

While dodging free traders and air/rafts, visiting travellers will be impressed by the lush earth and blue skies of Mertactor. Thanks to an absence of big industry and an abundance of scattered wilderness preserves, the planet has been able to maintain its clean air and natural landscape. Due to the planet's rather small size and close horizon, the clear azure skies seem to almost surround the reclining viewer. 

Offworlders are often uncomfortable with prolonged exposure to Mertactor's low gravity. Generally, hostels that cater to offworlders provide 1G suites for those who can't abide Mertactan lightfootedness for extended periods of time.
