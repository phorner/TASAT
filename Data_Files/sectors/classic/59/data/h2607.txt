Focaline

Family-owned ranches crowd the plains.  Focaline's major industry is Groat-raising; both cloth and unprocessed groat hair are exported, and groat meat is considered a delicacy by the neighboring Vargr. The small usable surface is somewhat overcrowded and strict population control is practiced.  A station for trading with Vargr is present.
