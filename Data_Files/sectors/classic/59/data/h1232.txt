Walston

Important excerpts: the class-B starport is rated as a scout base.  The population of 3,700 is largely Vargr.  On the average, cargo vessels leave Walston twice a year to carry produce to Caladbolg (via Datrillian.)
Walston's starport and the relatively hospitable environment makes it a popular stopover point on the Bowman Arm. The planet's subsistence-based economy depends largely on aquaculture and more conventional agriculture.
