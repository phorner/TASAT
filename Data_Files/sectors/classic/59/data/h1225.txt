Excalibur

A Darrian mining colony operated here before the Maghiz.  It died out when Darrian could no longer send out ships to pick up production and provide supplies. 

Excalibur has a cool climate with a very thin oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere tainted with volcanic gas and ash. 

Excalibur is resonantly locked with its primary, Artur, orbiting at a distance of 0.30 AU and rotating three times every two orbits. Many of its native life forms have evolved into "striders" that spend their entire life cycle following the sun. Excalibur has three small moons. While two are typical, the third, Bedwyr, seems to be a captured body, which entered orbit over Excalibur approximately 4,000-5,000 years ago.
