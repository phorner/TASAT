Kkirka

K'kirka is a mining community concerned with extracting rare earths from the mountain ranges. K'kirka has a pair of unusually dense moons, which have complex and highly eccentric orbits that create spectacular and extremely violent tides on the mainworld when both moons are at their closest approach.
