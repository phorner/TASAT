Maitz

Long a minor starport along the major routes, recent discoveries of radioactives in recoverable quantities have led to extensive development of the world's facilities.

The system is owned by Stellar Construction, a subsidiary of Tukera Lines. Ships built here are of high quality, and several experimental designs have been tested in the complex moon system of Maitz.
