Jokotre

Jokotre has a ideal environment and a balance of available water for producing food from plants, animals, or other forms. For generations Jokotre has been ruled by a religious dictatorship based on the worship of Ram, a local deity deified one thousand years ago.  Each true believer must make a pilgrimage to the holy lands once during his life.  No true believer may carry weapons into the holy land without being permanently defiled.  There is an active insurgency movement.
