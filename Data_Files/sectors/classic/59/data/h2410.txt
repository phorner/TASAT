Inthe is an agricultural world with a tainted atmosphere but still a near-ideal environment for producing foodstuffs.

Ancient site present. Large, artificial mounds of earth. tens of kilometers long, are scattered over a thousand square kilometers.  Analysis and excavation has given no clue to the purpose.  A large volcanic crater (now water-filled) lies on the plain in the center of the mounds: it may have been the site of an Ancient base.
