Grant

Grant is an interdicted world because the atmosphere of the planet has a particularly nasty hallucinogenic effect on humans - inducing extreme paranoia.  The atmosphere seems to penetrate even the best of hostile environment suits.  The world has been classified- off limits. Two orbital satellites enforce the rule and will take measures to make sure nobody enters the atmosphere.

The IISS also patrols this area.
