Collace

Settled in the period 450-490, after the release of the First Survey. 

Produces a wide variety of low-cost, high-tech goods.

Highest population world in District 268, and major industrial center.  Collace was one of the first worlds settled in the District, and is the primary candidate for its capital when or if it is integrated into the Imperium.

Collace is a world of water, with huge oceans that cover a full four-fifths of its surface. The atmosphere is very thin, providing little protection against the glaring sunlight of the system’s primary star, and is also badly tainted. Accordingly, those who wish to move around in the open must use combination filter/respirator masks and wear thorough protection against sunburn.
