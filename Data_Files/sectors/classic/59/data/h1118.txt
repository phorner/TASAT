Garda-Vilis  

A council of military officers from Vilis govern this world of 475 million.  There is widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling council.  Most residents live in farming areas and several small cities clustered around the starport/scout base complex on the largest continent. Planetary resources are adequate for local needs. 

The Mosaic Desert is a much discussed local attraction. Hidden between two mountain ranges, this natural wonder covers several hundred square kilometers. Access is by land vehicle: high winds caused by the mountains makes flying slightly hazardous.  Natural geologic processes laid down a variety of different colored minerals in layers on an ancient seabed.  Seismic disturbances tilted that seabed, and allowed a gentle wind-erosion to uncover the layers.  The resulting Mosaic Desert is endless patterns of brilliant colors.
