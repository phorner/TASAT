Flexos

The atmosphere of this planet is carbon dioxide/nitrogen, which allows basic plants to be used as atmosphere converters in greenhouses.  The inhabitants are all descendants of the 14 passengers and crewmembers of a starship which misjumped about 650, and was not discovered for approximately 80 years. Extensive inbreeding has caused a good deal of genetic drift/damage.  The current inhabitants are all very uniform in appearance, bald, albino, and six fingered.  They have little desire to breed outside the group (and vice  versa!) and the population is declining.  The ship is still partially functional at the core of the inhabited area.

Flexos is a low-population backwater typical of the region. With only 60,000 people in its mid-tech communities, and further handicapped by having to contend with an exotic atmosphere, the world exports little and can afford few imports. Without substantial offworld investment Flexos will probably remain at the subsistence level forever. 

Investment in such a marginal world tends to be cheap (though it is often not worth doing anyway). This may be one reason why a variety of survey teams and explorers have recently arrived on Flexos. There are rumors of chemical- extraction processes that may turn Flexos’ fluid oceans into an economic asset, but no hard data is available.
