Ektron     

Ektron is a world with one of the shortest years in the Confederation.  It has a very thin atmosphere requiring respirator/filter mask combinations for residents.  A family of fruit trees on Ektron retains carbon dioxide in its leaves, which locals use to brew a carbonated tea.  The tea is exported to other worlds of the Confederation as a novelty drink.  Ektron's mountain leapers provide an insulating wool used for much of the local clothing.
