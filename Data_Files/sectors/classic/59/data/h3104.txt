Until a LSP survey discovered lanthanum deposits, this world was unpopulated.  When the lodes proved insufficient for commercial mining, LSP made the report public and offered to rent prospecting equipment in return for an interest in any discoveries.  The offer maintains a small population of fortune-seekers, but without visible results.
