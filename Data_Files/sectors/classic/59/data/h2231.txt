Marastan

Marastan has an ideal environment for producing agricultural goods and an balanced population between 10 and 100 million. This world designated as an Amber Zone. Caution is advised since the world has an environment, laws, customs, life forms, or other conditions that are not well understood and might be a danger to a visitor.

The Imperial Reserve here contains sprawling examples of flora and fauna collected by the IISS during surveys and explorations.  This Imperial collection, available for research only by accredited scholars, is one of the largest in the Imperium.  Although the Emperor has never visited it, it is reported that action holograms of the collection are used for decoration and entertainment at the Summer Palace on Umgadin in Core. 

Discovery of fabulously rich mineral deposits on the major continent led major industrial concerns to pressure the Imperial government to open Marastan to off-world development.  The Imperium set a date when a survey ship would arrive, and determine what governments existed and what areas they controlled.  A mad scramble began.
