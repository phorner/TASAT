MELIOR

A desert, poor, non-industrial world located in the Glisten Subsector of the Spinward Marches. The population is split between the Jonkeereen and the Human colonists, each living in their own enclaves. The colony is administered by the Ministry of Colonization. 

Melior is a long-term terraforming project, being administered by the MinCol branch office on Egypt.  Large quantities of ice asteroids are being diverted and used to bombard the planet.  Their impacts have all been precalculated to avoid inhabited areas, but mistakes have occurred and MinCol takes no responsibility for ships landing away from the scientific outpost.  There are no exports of any significance.  This phase of the terraforming project is scheduled to be completed in 1150, and has been underway since  1090. MinCol  will contract for pusher ships on a freelance basis. - Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)
