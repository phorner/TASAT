Hefry

The settlement on Hefry owes its existence to the big Scout base there and is heavily dependent on the business it brings. The base houses the Scouts' district administrative headquarters for the entire Regina subsector and is a hive of activity. 

Berthing fees are cr1,000 rather than cr100.
