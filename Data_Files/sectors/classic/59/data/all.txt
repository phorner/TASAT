Spinward Marches
The Imperium's farthest frontier sector is divided along a coreward to rimward line by the Imperial border. The region is dominated by two major powers: the Imperial Spinward Marches sector and the frontier provinces of the Zhodani Consulate. In the independent territory between the two powers lie three small states: the Federation of Arden, the Sword Worlds Confederation, and the Darrian Confederation. Each follows its own diplomatic line designed to maintain independence from both the Zhodani and the Imperium.
 
The Spinward Marches has been settled since the 400s and is still a frontier sector. High-tech worlds are scattered among empty, fallow worlds; there is potential for exploration, exploitation, and development for centuries to come. 

The Lunion subsector is the Imperial jumping-off point for the Five Sisters subsector, as well as the major trade connection with the Sword Worlds. As a result, trade is the be-all and end all of most worlds' economies; all manner of trade goods - legal and illegal alike - thrive in trade throughout not only the subsector, but the Spinward marches sector as a whole. Key to Stroudens' success as a major trade hub is not only it's commercially strategic position in the region, but it's militarily strategic position and ship construction yards, run by Ling Standard products.
