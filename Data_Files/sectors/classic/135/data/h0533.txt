Skyron

The 47,000 underground inhabitants of Skyron are ruled by the Viraanid family, which is directly descended from the Vilani noble to whom the planet was first ceded. Such an uninviting planet hardly seems like a suitable gift for a loyal noble. In fact, Baron Viraanid was not a very loyal noble, and his superior was attempting to get him out of the way in this remote sector by awarding him Skyron, sight unseen.

When the Baron arrived with his 1,000 retainers plus their families, he was angered, but wise enough not to complain. The immigrants dug in and built a comfortable, if not luxurious, underground world for themselves.  Here they rode out the Rule of Man, the Long Night, and the centuries of re-expansion until they were recontacted by an Imperium that no longer remembered why they were there.

There are a few natural gems on Skyron, and the people are famous for the luxury fabrics they produce. The local nobles have plenty to trade for luxuries from the rest of the sector.
