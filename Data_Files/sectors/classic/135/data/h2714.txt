Theocracy of Radimyr, excellent bladed weapons


Pinnashdug is completely dominated by the priests of Radimyr, a local deity whose worship sprang up during the Long Night. Increased use of unwise sources of power during the collapse of the Rule of Man led to the pollution of the atmosphere, and as the resources required simply to breathe dwindled, desperation kindled the spark of extremism. 

 The worthiness of an individual is measured against Radimyr, supposedly the first man from Earth itself to have set foot on the planet, using a probably apocryphal and corrupted list of his features and virtues. The result is the citizen's Virtue, and resources, facilities, and healthcare are assigned in strict order of this rating. 

 During the Long Night, this would actually extend to denying clean breathable air to the "unholy" so that the "pure" might survive. Nowadays, there is enough of most things to go around, and Virtue is more a measure of status than lide and death. However, people whose Virtue drops below a certain level still have a tendency to disappear; in any other society this would be a crime-and-punishment phenomenom, but on Pinnashdug, not to be Virtuous is the worst crime of all.

 In an ironic twist of fate, Pinnashdug's slightly toxic atmosphere actually has a beneficial effect on metal blades forged in it. Bladed weapons made on Pinnashdug are of a much higher quality and considerably stronger than those made elsewhere in the subsector, and command high prices from collectors and specialists in their use. The rather tedious ceremonies required to obtain one are generally regarded as an acceptable inconvenience by such people.
