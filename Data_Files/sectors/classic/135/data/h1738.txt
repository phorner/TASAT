Hamilcar

Subsector capitol. Settled early in the Rule of Man by a cultural group derived from Terran Polynesia, this world is also one of the many worlds to which dolphins were transplanted before they were made sentient.

Now that sentient dolphins also exist, populations of both types are found on Hamilcar, coexisting with relative ease. Two million of the two billion population of the world are sentient dolphins. Most of the humans live in ship cities and consequently share some of the dolphin attitude toward ownership of property.

In an astonishing political coup, the dolphins have put one of their own into power on Hamilcar. The dolphin Keekiiteep is widely acclaimed as a wise statesman even on other worlds of the subsector. Of course, politics is not a typical dolphin interest, but getting people to cooperate and live harmoniously is a worthy goal, even to a dolphin. The heritage of the easy going Polynesian culture makes the human population more receptive to Keekiiteep's guidance.

The high law level reflects primarily the taboo on violence; personal freedom is very little restricted.
