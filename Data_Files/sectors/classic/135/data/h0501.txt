The "taint" which is shared by these worlds is believed to be the product of a nearby nova many centuries ago. When mingled with water, the taint forms an organic molecule relished by plankton. Thus both worlds support a rich sea life which is harvested to feed not only the inhabitants, but worlds throughout the subsector.
