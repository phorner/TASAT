Ruled by the Asteroid Prospecting Council of Aqilat (APCA), Aqilat's primary industry is the extraction of gemstones. It is hypothesised that the asteroid belt that forms the only solid body in the system was a byproduct of the Final War, and that the weapon used to acheive this destruction did something peculiar to some of the minerals making up the planet. Careful propecting can locate and recover small red gems known locally as Dekan Teardrops, or Tears of Dekan, not found anywhere else in known space. These are very desirable as jewelry and fetch good prices. 

While obedience to the Miners' Code (mostly concerned with the staking, maintaining and working of claims, and the tithing of earnings to the government) is enforced absolutely by APCA, there are no other laws or restrictions on life and death among the asteroids of Aqilat.
