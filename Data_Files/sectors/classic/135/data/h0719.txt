
Weipu is a pretty, planet possessing vast forested regions with scattered lakes and small seas. History records how many spacefarers found Weipu to look very inviting by comparison with its near neighbors: desert Ippurash, chilly, methane rich Thars, and the Stralsund asteroids.

But Weipu is void of any human colonization or even robot intrusion Q it instead is ruled by a unique metal consuming bacteria evolved in its mineral laden hot springs.

The first humans to land on Weipu were stranded by the inexplicable breakdown of their ship and most of their machinery. They eventually realized that something organic was the cause of their problem, but had little equipment left with which to investigate. A second wave of colonists landed and left in short order, bearing the survivors of the first wave with them. The colonists from both parties were quarantined on an asteroid at Stralsund and the ships dismantled.

The bacteria, while not directly pathogenic, can live in the human intestine. All colonists living on the Stralsund asteroid eventually died of iron, copper, and zinc deficiencies.

The planet was interdicted. The bacteria is a widespread and essential link in the planetary ecology. Eradicating it would wipe out all native lifeforms on the world.
