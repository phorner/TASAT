Ariel is an iceworld, with most of its' water sealed in the icecaps and the remainder blasted around the unbreatheably thin atmosphere as perpetual snow by the constant wind. Very few creatures live here, but the few very hardy ones that do manage to survive, and the mosses and lichens that cling to the frozen rocks, produce some useful by-products not available from other environments. Exporting these supports the population, but not in any great comfort or plenty, and the poor facilities for a type B starport reflect this.
