Undeveloped and disregarded. Much crime. Liberty world for Imperial forces.


Newcomb is a backwater, an undeveloped world with little to encourage anyone to invest in it. Fifty thousand people live there, in a remarkable fair and well-structured culture with a democratic government; but there is little for the governement to preside over, as the world produces little and earns less. 

Crime and delinquency are serious problems on Newcomb, as the younger generations discover just how poor their prospects are.

Imperial services have a tendency to use Newcomb as a liberty world, descending to party and blow off steam just outside the starport and leaving again. Even this doesn't generate much income.
