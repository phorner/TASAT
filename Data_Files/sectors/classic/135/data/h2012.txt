
Cathay is controlled by the Ninshanko religion, which is native and unique to this world.

Apparently driven by fear of the nearby Vegans, with their many philosophies and free choice among them, the Ninshanko leaders clamp down on their people in every aspect of their lives. Children are raised in religious creches, homes are inspected for compliance with every rule of the creed, and off-planet travel is forbidden. Ironically, asking what another follower thinks about his beliefs is a serious crime on Cathay.

The only reason Cathay is not an amber zone is that these restrictions do not really apply to offworlders. An offworlder who makes trouble (including asking "rude" questions) will not be thrown in jail; he will be calmly escorted to the starport entrance and told to never return.
