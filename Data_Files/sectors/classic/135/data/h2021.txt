Ishimshulgi

This little world used to have a thin atmosphere and a few oceans, before the Terran corporation GenAssist attempted some improvements.

Several centuries ago, the corporation attempted to "encourage" a native lifeform which fixed nitrogen into the soil for use by the local plants. It was not a widespread or prolific lifeform, and the corporate personnel were hoping to encourage it in order to spread the local agriculture regions farther. GenAssist genetically altered some of the bacteria for prolificity. The alterations worked, and in a few short years, the entire soil surface was fixing nitrogen at a prodigious rate. In fact, the nitrogen levels in the atmosphere were dropping at an alarming rate. GenAssist tried desperately to create at an "antidote" lifeform, but to no avail. In a bizarre twist of events, one of the "antidote" attempts mutated into an alternate strain capable of storing oxygen in the soil. In a little over a century, the entire atmosphere of Ishimshulgi was locked in the world's crust.

The Ishimshulgians are understandably embittered at being driven into sealed habitats on what used to be a habitable planet. Many left the world when the debacle became obvious, and the remainder filed a claim against GenAssist that took the corporation over 20 years to pay off. The payments for damages have been used to "bubble terraform" several locations on the planet's surface.

The 94,000 inhabitants are divided into nations made up of a given land area, regardless of population. These are strictly for convenience in management; they are all essentially participating democracies with some traces of technocracy.
