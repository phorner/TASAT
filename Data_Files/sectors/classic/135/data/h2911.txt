Democratic world producing excellent robots


Sathyos is a democracy, rather rare in the Third Imperium, and especially where the population is reasonably high. Seventy million people live here, and all adults have the vote. Sathyos' high technological level means the infrastructure is present to make this possible, and the system is actually governed for the most part by the will of the collected citizenry. 

 Sathyos manufactures and exports quality robots. The Wilson and May factory is located here, producing some of the best robots available in the Solomani Rim.
