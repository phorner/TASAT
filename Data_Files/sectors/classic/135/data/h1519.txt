Bellerophon is home to Daghadasi, huge sea-dwelling beast.

Derived from the Old Earth dialect of Turkish, the name means "mountain-island", and describes a gigantic beast that really does resemble a free-floating island, complete with its own local flora and fauna. The largest specimens, the so-called Great Daghadasi or daghadadedes, frequently exceed 2 km in length; some unverified sightings claim sightings of behemoths 10 km long. Most are members of loosely-knit herds, generally including at least one daghadadede and several dozen young.
