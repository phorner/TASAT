Major trade center.


As a High Population rated world near to a political border, Mandrake is a natural for a significant trade centre, and has prospered from this over the years. Recently, however, the gathering clouds of war have impacted the trade on which it depends, and the commercial heartbeat of the system is becoming irregular. 

Voruuzheng, Earl of Mandrake, is an atypical person, and not merely because he is a Vargr. He has deduced the likely path of events in his region pretty accurately, and has begun preparations for the war he knows is coming. As a High Pop world, Mandrake is a major target for any Solomani invasion, and Voruuzheng has been planning for this. Mandrake now has the toughest system defences of any non-military system on the border, paid for from extra taxes which paradoxically have improved Voruuzheng's standing with his people, as they now feel better protected.
