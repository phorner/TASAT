Poor world, Overlord Drake facing rebellion from oppressed population


Onathy is a poor backwater, with minimal air and water, no asteroid belt, and no gas giants. Things are not improved by the behaviour of the ruler, Vladimir Drake, styling himself Overlord. His palace is luxurious beyond the dreams of the average citizen, and his favoured few enjoy a lifestyle quite at odds with the system's income and economics. 

 Overlord Drake remains in control, mainly because his "nobility" of enfranchised people exert control over the mass of the population, but a vigorous opposition has recently bloomed into a full-blown rebellion and his chances of retaining control are fading rapidly. 

 Mercenary companies operating in the sector have already begun to make offers to both sides, scenting a coming war.
