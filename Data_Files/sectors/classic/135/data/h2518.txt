Major trade center. Produces light weapons and military uniforms


As a High Population rated world near to a political border, Ganesh is a natural for a significant trade centre, and has prospered from this over the years. Recently, however, the gathering clouds of war have impacted the trade on which it depends, and the commercial heartbeat of the system is becoming irregular. 

Unlike Dipsuka, its' Imperial counterpart, Ganesh has found an answer to this problem, and has diversified into the manufacture of weapons and uniforms, under the Ganesh Military Supplies brand. Most of the light hand weapons used by Solomani forces in the subsector are supplied from Ganesh, and almost all the uniforms. The government hopes this will make them important enough to Solomani taticians to ensure their system's defence.
