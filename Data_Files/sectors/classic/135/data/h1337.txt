
Sequoyah was settled early in the Rule of Man by a visionary group who believed they could improve human society and human thought by creating a new, artificial language with none of the built-in logic errors of natural language. The Sequoyahns hope was that this would stop people from thinking that any emotional relationship means owning another person, and so on, thus avoiding much of the problems of society.

Unfortunately some people can manage to think things that defy logic no matter what the language, so the society of Sequoyah is less logical than its founders had hoped. Also, it is often difficult for the linguist-philosophers who still rule the world to agree on what the "true thoughts" are, so the language can reflect them. And no sooner is a section of language created than it begins to evolve just like any natural language.

Despite Sequoyah's philosophical difficulties, it is a physically pleasant world, with few laws, and rich in mineral resources. Many of its 8 billion people are immigrants in the last few generations.
