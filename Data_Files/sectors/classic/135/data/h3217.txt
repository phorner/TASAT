Pollution has destroyed the crops, trade is failing and the population dropping


Massive pollution has reduced this once Agricultural world to a shadow of its' former self. 95% of the crops have died out, and only a fraction of the population of 250 years ago remains. Large areas of the starport (notably the trade halls) are falling into dereliction, and entire cities lie empty and ruined across the planet's surface. It is predicted that Cephesa will become Uninhabited within another 100 years.
