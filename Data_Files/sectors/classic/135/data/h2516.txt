Mining for many metals and minerals, rule by Wayland Corporation's Energy Barons


Urizen is provided with a combination of an appalling atmosphere that will destroy even battledress in a day or so, and deep deposits of a wide range of desirable metals and minerals. 

The Solomani Wayland Corporation operates here, and has a monopoly on the mining process as well as all the other facets of daily life. More than anything, the Corporation exterts power through energy. All the planetary power plants are controlled by Wayland, and they are quite capable of enforcing the law - the only law, obedience to Wayland Corporation - by witholding power from the recalcitrant.

The senior executives of the Wayland Corporation are known locally as the Energy Barons.
