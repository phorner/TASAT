Major shipyards, security very tight, ruled by the Confederation Navy


Murphy has long been the primary site of starship construction in the subsector, but with the increasing tensions in the region, all facilities have been taken over by the Confederation directly for military shipbuilding. Control of the government has been assumed by the Confederation navy, and Admiral James Brannigan is now defacto ruler of the system.

Security is understandably important at a place like this, but Brannigan has been taken it to extremes and Murphy has become a full-fledged police state, with few or no personal liberties for the unfortunate inhabitants outside the Naval base. Brannigan is not a popular leader.
