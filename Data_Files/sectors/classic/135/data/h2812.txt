Peculiar atmosphere, waystation comandeered for Army, Marine and Navy


Nisinasha, like Easter, is egg-shaped, distorted by tidal forces far in the past, when it was much closer to its gas giant primary. Its atmosphere, however, is nearly spherical, producing near-vacuum at the ends, too-high pressure at the middle, and two habitable bands between these extremes. 

 The Scout Waystation has been comandeered by the Imperial Navy, in reaction to the increased local tensions, and is now a military base of considerable size. Army, Navy and Marines all have significant forces stationed here.
