Local world war approaching, with Hi and TL D


While the rest of the Solomani Rim is about to go up in flames as the Imperium and Solomani Confederation go to war, Ludovic has its' own problems. Balkanized into thirty-five seperate nations, two power blocs have emerged over the last ten years and a world war is imminent. What makes this disasterous is the combination of a High Population rating (eight billion inhabitants) and a healthy Tech Level of D, meaning seriously powerful weapons are available to inflict misery on a very large number of people.
