Vilani settlers had landed on a number of worlds in the upper half of this sector before the Solomani discovered jump drive. The lower half, especially rimward of Terra, was settled almost exclusively by Solomani. In the first centuries of expansion from Terra, some worlds were selected for commercial value, or as jumping off points for better worlds. Some were settled by various subcultures from Earth seeking places to live by themselves.

Some of these subcultures died out rather quickly and their planets were later resettled by more cosmopolitan groups. Many others are now indistinguishable from other high-tech worlds of the Imperium or Solomani sphere. However, the traces of the original philosophies may still be seen on some of the planets of the Rim.
