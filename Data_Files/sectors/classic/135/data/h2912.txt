Devastated by apocalyptic nuclear war, rival nations still fighting


Rild is what Ludovic will one day become. The tensions between the six nations controlling its' land surface escalated out of control until 977, when an all-out nuclear exchange devastated all the major population centres. Rild had been a High Population world before this happened, with six billion inhabitants; seventy million remain as of 989.

 Usually when this happens, the horror of the holocaust they have unleashed shocks the survivors into more sensible behaviour. On Rild, however, international hatreds are so deeply ingrained that even after atomic Armageddon the fighting did not cease. Across shattered cites and blasted, glazed, radioactive wastelands the war goes on, and in such cases the Imperium has a clear and callous policy; lock the inhabitants up in their own mess and leave them to it. 

 A squadron of Imperial warships patrols the high orbit of the mainworld, preventing anyone from landing on or leaving Rild. The survivors have managed to retain a basic spacefaring technology, although as more and more of their civilization is irreperably shattered, the available facilities and systems disappear, and before much longer they will lose the ability to put ships into space, even were the interdicting forces to allow them to leave.
