
Santorini earned its name almost immediately upon being settled in the 700s. The small land masses dotted around its oceans are all volcanic islands in various stages of activity or dormancy. The atmosphere is constantly clouded by ash in the stratosphere and gases from the latest eruption (the density of the atmosphere keeps debris aloft longer than average, too).

The original government was oligarchic, but after the Great Disaster in 734, the scientific community staged a coup and set about cleaning up the eruption damage. An all-out search for extinct islands was conducted, along with a careful mapping of plate boundaries. Today, most of the population lives on non-volcanic islands, or in shallow water arcologies with protective seawalls against tsunamis. Several seas are fairly shallow and conducive to seafloor construction.

Much of the wealth of Santorini is connected with its vigorous volcanic activity. It is well supplied with gems, minerals, and ores, and its people produce manufactured goods for off-planet trade. Sea life is also a source of valuable goods such as specialty foods, medicines, perfumes and dyes, and organic gems.
