Two GG and a belt, navigation hard, poor metals. Some belters.


Immir is a peculiar system, with two massive gas giants bracketing a single asteroid belt. The gravitational patterns are extremely complex, making insystem navigation much harder here than it is elsewhere. This, coupled with the fact that only low-yield products like iron, nickel and small amounts of gold are found here, makes prospecting here difficult to make pay. Yet a small corporation, based at Noricum, has an outpost here and employs crews to scour the meteors for saleable metals.
