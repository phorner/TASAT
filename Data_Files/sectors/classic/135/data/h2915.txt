Major imperial muster point


Pajang is the nearest Imperial Naval Base to the border, and has been designated as a mustering point for several fleets of Imperial warships. Space around the mainworld is becoming relatively crowded, and the planetary population (divided into seven rival but peaceable nations) is protesting violently about the drain on the oceans caused by fuel dipping; Pajang has no gas giant. This is unlikely to take any serious form, but Naval personnel out on the town occasionally find their welcome in the city bars less convivial than they'd like.
