
A balkanized, industrialized world lying near the Great Rift.  Trill's many distinct nations all jealously guard their own independence, in addition to their borders.  Differences between the nations make it possible for a variety of factions to be supported by a variety of nations.  Trill lies far enough from any every major faction to make laying siege a difficult proposition; in addition, Trill's nation's own spacecraft could provide enough resistance to break a siege.

Trill has 15 major nations (each with a population of about 100 million.)  Factions supporting Lucan, Dulinor, Margaret, and Vland have managed to gain a foothold in at least two nations each; the others remain undecided and open to persuasion.

Each faction makes use of its foothold on Trill to propagandize neighboring, uncommitted nations.  Since no faction holds a clear advantage, all must force themselves to tolerate the existence of others.  Even pitched battles and military campaigns on Trill must respect national borders or risk retaliation by the offended country and alienation from other nations.
