    The Aplaudira Plains  on sandswept Teghde are the home  of the 4 yearly
    Aplaudira  Sandyacht champonships.  Whilst sandyachting  takes place on
    many worlds  of the sector it is to Teghde and Aplaudira  that devotees
    make their  olympian pilgrimage. The  10 days of  the Championships are
    also a  popular social occasion  for the Gushemege  nobility and Sector
    Duke Kirshaam  Miikadgaa is a  regular visitor to  the event. When  the
    championships are not  running the plains are still  host to a sizeable
    sandyachting  fraternity who  claim  that  Aplaudira's sands  are "well
    crucial" and without equal in the Sector.

    El Tquii Nebula

    Between  grids 2932  and 2933  in  Lagan  Subsector lies  the El  Tquii
    nebula. This  gaseous nebula extends  for nearly one  and a half  light
    years and its  glorious colours dominate the skies  of Grebele, Teghde,
    and other nearby  worlds. Deep in the heart of  the nebula lie a couple
    of young suns, whose development is closely watched by the IISS base on
    Grebele. Periodic  survey expeditions are  made into the  centre of the
    nebula, and automated recording stations  are deployed in various parts
    of the nebula to keep a constant record of the stellar evolution.
