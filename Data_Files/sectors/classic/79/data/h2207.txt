Lancia is an Intelligent minor race of humaniti native to Irkhi. The Lancia cultural region was extensively ravaged by the Vilani during the Consolidation Wars , and the Lancians have resented Vilani influences since.

The region was resettled from the Vland sector under a special program sponsored by Makhidkarun.
