
Abrr Subsector:
Contains the Addaxur Reservation. The original name for the subsector as the Zhodani explored was Tsachi. After the Addaxur were discovered, the name for the region became Abrr ("Surprise"). The Council Seat retains the original name.



Subsector Capitals:
The practice of naming the subsector after its capital world has lapsed during the 6,000 years the Zhodani have occupied Tienspevnekr. In several cases the capital has changed at least once. Originally, a subsector would be named for the dominant world, as that world was the defacto center of civilization. As the sector became fully settled and travel technology improved, some capitals shifted according to the needs of the Subsector Councils. Some Councils needed to be at the center of activity while some wished to be isolated (in order to get any work done). The  worlds of She'atadl, Eqiatl, Zarontse, Jianjshte and Anienj are "Consulate Resorts", where the entire world is dedicated to the support of the Subsector Council. Such worlds rarely have any factors which would interfere with the activities of the resident Council (though they still have Councilors). The populations of these worlds is largely transient, as Councilors and their various staff members come and go.
    The "Racial Populations" entry provides a code for the presense of Aslan, but I have not yet placed any, nor decided if there WILL be any The "land-urge" of the Aslan would be disruptive in Consulate space, so there probably aren't very many.
