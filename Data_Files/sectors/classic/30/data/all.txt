Known first as Ligim sector to the Vilani of the First Imperium, and wearing thin with the years, the Vilani references are more of a faded image of the region's past, lost in the era of the Rule of Man (Second Imperium) and then the Long Night. Ligim translates into Galanglic roughly as Star Stream. The Am Rir, literally the Vilani words for "Rift", serves as the coreward demarcation of First Imperial boundaries across the sector's mid-section. Of course, Vilani scouts did penetrate the region enough to explore most of the sector in that period of the First Imperium and Pre-Imperial times. 

The region's second historic period was largely influenced by events to spinward, beginning with the Sack of Gashikan, early in the Long Night. Many Vargr fled the Empire of Gushashi, parts of which were forming into the First Empire of Gashikan, after the Sack, and filled out territories known today as the Vargr Enclaves. Consistent with that history, the local Vargr dialect's name for the sector is Ogzuekhfos meaning Hegira in the common human toungue. 

The K'kree name for this sector is Ktiin'gzat, and Solomani (Terran) names vary, but perhaps the most common name is Legends.
