Yehta

Yehta is simply the largest of the planetoids in its orbit. Pulled from three directions by their two primaries and a gas giant, these fragments could never coalesce into a larger mass. The planetoids do contain almost every element in the periodic table; this area of space has been through three or four cycles of supernova explosions since the formation of the universe; each cycle forms and scatters heavier elements. Yehta attracted a sizable belter population from several clans (whose relations are usually rather tense.)
