Hteoe

Most animal life is subterranean, living in the vast systems of underground caverns hollowed br ground water. The caverns, indeed, are far better supplied with water than the surface. Because of this ecology, the Aslan of Hteoe have also become cavern dwellers -- an unusual adaptation for Aslan on a world with a breathable atmosphere.
