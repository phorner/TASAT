Paro

A large, non-industrial water world with an insidious atmosphere and a population of 6.3 million.  Paro is 'owned' and operated by Universal Paro Systems, Ltd., an Imperially-chartered corporation consisting of literally every inhabitant on the planet.  Paro is the site of an Imperial Scout base, and the system has a gas giant.

Paro purchases a respectable quantity of electronic equipment vacc suits (which must be replaced regularly, because of corrosive effects from the planet's atmosphere.)
