Oixber

Home of the famous AK mercenaries, this asteroid belt is divided among several influential families. Each family maintains a small private army (perhaps 500 men) to guard its own interests in the mineral rich belt, as well as for hire outsystem. Those who hire out are not only skilled in weightless maneuvering, but are also trained in artificial gravity fields up to two gravities to maintain their physical condition.

Most such groups are equipped to the limits of the tech level 11 facilities available. Oixber mercenaries are justly famous throughout their subsector, though the AKs are the only group widely known beyond the subsector.
