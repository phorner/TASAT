Larspri

Tiny, dense Larspri holds an atmosphere of hydrogen and carbon compounds only because it is fairly far from its primary. These react with the metals on the surface to produce corrosive and poisonous compounds. Its tiny hydrosphere is composed of frozen carbon dioxide at the poles.

This lump of matter would be good for nothing if it were rock, but is almost pure metal. Scientists have speculated that it may be a chunk of a planetary core left after the planet was smashed by comets, or even a chunk of a burnt-out dwarf star. Larspri is a rich source of metals from copper through transuranics.

Due to the inhospitable conditions no lives there, but 12 major companies have mining claims which are worked by specially designed robots, impervious to corrosion.
