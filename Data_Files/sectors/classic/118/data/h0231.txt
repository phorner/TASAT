Thorrel

Thorellians, intelligent minor race native on Thorell, is well adapted to its near-vacuum world, although archaeologists and geologists maintain the atmosphere was thicker at one time. Thorellians are a burrowing race, built long and low, with six limbs. They can see an electromagnetic spectrum from green through microwaves.

Many interconnecting burrows make up a city, which is synonymous with  a Thorellian nation. there are at least 300 such nations plus smaller groupings and loners on the planet. Territorial disputes are common but usually non-violent.

Thorell is a Scout Service Red Zone, interdicted until the natives progress sufficiently to enter the interstellar community.
