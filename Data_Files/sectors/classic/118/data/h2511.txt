Dorp

Dorp was lightly populated in the 700's by colonists escaping from the constant international tension on nearby Bourj. The population grew slowly and was quite content with the world. However, twenty years ago detected the first signs of instability in the star. The inhabitants were evacuated by the Scout Service and various merchant interests. The refugees were taken to Khar/Twenty-one Worlds, where they are assimilating nicely.

A crew of astronomers remains in a jump-capable vessel, specially equipped to house them for years. They intend to observe the star until the last possible moment, gathering data not obtainable from a distance, and then jump clear.
