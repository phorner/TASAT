
Isolated beyond easy jump distance, Garden has only been visited by humans within the past three centuries. Colonists began arriving in 1079, desiring a new world to farm in peace. Garden's relative inaccessibility to the rest of the universe suited them perfectly, as their initial thoughts were to get back to nature and leave much of technology behind.

Garden's first explorers found the remnants of another civilization. This prior civilization ended abruptly around 1000.  Buildings were still intact, and all signs pointed to a mass migration offworld. At the time, no one knew the identity or destination of Garden's original inhabitants. The inhabitants were identified within the last ten years as the Salika, a non-human minor race.

The colonists found the planet's environment in an unbalanced state. Abnormally high carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere were warming the planet.  Garden's climate was further worsened by its star, a long-period irregular variable, now in a bright phase. All in all, Garden was much less habitable than its name implied.

Aided by the Imperial Ministry of Colonization, the settlers began a wide-scale atmospheric terraforming project. Designed to remove the excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it has already started to show slight signs of cooling the planet's climate.

Garden's current inhabitants live by a strict conservation ethic. They refuse to use any sort of destructive or explosive technology.  They shy away even from using chemical fertilizers or pesticides in agriculture, and put considerations of environment foremost in their work. What technology as exists on Garden is used for power, communications, or environmental control purposes. The starport is the only planetary installation to sport a high degree of automation.
