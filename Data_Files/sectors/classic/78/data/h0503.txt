
A cold world, Lintl is the subsector capital. Its 39 billion inhabitants are bound by the constraints of the local religion. Three autarch-priests govern, interpreting and executing the demands of the faith.

In Lintlian belief, all beings are elements of a mass consciousness, the Totality. The Totality is defined as the sum of all individual minds. By living according to the standards of the faith, each individual can maintain his contact with the Totality after death; otherwise he is condemned to an endless future of complete mental isolation.

The autarch-priests have inculcated this belief into the populace, linking the world's laws with the religion of the masses. Despite Lintl's high population, order is maintained through a dogma of fear.
