Travellers are advised to adhere to guidance instructions from the starport authority as inner system travel is especially threatened. The starport is at one of the space habitats in synchronous orbit around the main world. The world itself is interdicted.

Centuries ago, before the Third Imperium restored interstellar exchange, insystem shuttles fell into disrepair, and the world's inhabitants were isolated from their fellows in space. The ground society quickly descended to barbarism and forgot the people in orbit.

In recent times the habitat dwellers have replaced their interplanetary craft with Imperial aid, and they now have the equivalent of a class-B starport. At the Imperium's insistence, however, they have not recontacted the population on the ground. The Imperial Navy requested that the developing culture be protected from the interference of outside activity.

This last has drawn some attention in the sector news media, for the Navy is rarely interested in protecting developing cultures. It is generally the IISS that takes an interest in placing such worlds off-limits.  Rumors of unusual lifeforms and psionic activity among R'bak's ground-dwellers persist. These rumors have led some researchers to pinpoint R'bak as the site of a top-security military research project.
