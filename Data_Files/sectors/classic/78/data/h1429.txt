Orphee

Orphee is homeworld to the Orpheides, a minor race of low-tech herbivores.

The world does have a small human academic community who study the Orpheides society. However, it has been interdicted to trade and naval traffic by the Convention of Interdiction (5575 AD /1054 Imperial ). This was signed by all worlds with the Islands Clusters . Occasional ships carrying supplies and researchers do call on the system from time to time.

The interdiction of Orphee is equivalent to a Red Travel Zone within the Imperium.

Orpheides
Intelligent minor race native to Orphee. Descended from herbivorous grazer stock, the Orpheides have only achieved rudimentary development (approximating TL 0). Despite this, their culture at that level has proven of interest to academics throughout the Island Clusters .

It is expected that the Orpheides, with suitable protection from interference, can achieve a technological civilisation within a few thousand years. To this end, Orphee itself has been interdicted (making it the equivalent of a Red Zone within the Imperium).
