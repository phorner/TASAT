Ye-Lu

Navy scientists at Ye-Lu are particularly proud of their accomplishments; the Ye-Lu starport is operated by the Imperial Navy as a research project, testing the limits of robotic networking.  The entire corps of robots at the facility is tied together in one gigantic master/slave network.  Theoretically, the entire starport is one robot with only one brain, but the brain is dispersed throughout the complex.  All communications between the robots is handled by portable meson communicators, another important experimental device developed by the Imperial Navy at Ye-Lu.
