Bogustin

Vincent V'cabi was hired in 958 by Hartin Corporation to head up a colony on Bogustin.  The colonists built a giant orbital complex, and spends much of its time in a total terraforming project to make the world inhabitable.  Hartin went bankrupt forty years after the colony was founded, and V'cabi proclaimed himself as V'cabi I.  Now 198 years old, thanks to anagathics and good Vilani bloodlines, he still rules the rule.  His doting popu-lation is gearing up for the bicentennial celebration of the government.  Bogustin Studios is well known for its fine holographic entertainment programs, many of which are computer generated.
