Ameros

About 50 years ago, the famous financial banking megacorporation Hortalez et Cie, LIC underwrote one of the most ambitious terra-forming projects to date in the Imperium on the world of Ameros.  The pilot project seeks to completely transform the surface of Ameros from a barren, airless rock into a world with a thin atmosphere and 10% hydrosphere in less than 100%.  If successful, the project will pave the way for comfortable colonization of otherwise inhospitable moons and planets.

The progress on Ameros has been disappointing so far: its atmosphere is only up to a trace level from its original vacuum state and its hydrosphere has been increased to a mere 2%, all of which is currently in the form of ice.  Hortalez et Cie has expressed some concern over the discouraging progress.  The research team on the world has assured the banking firm that the project is actually closer to being on track than it appears: they contend that the last 25% of a terra-forming period is when the most dramatic results appear.
