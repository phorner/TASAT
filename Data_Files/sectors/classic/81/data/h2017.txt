Onon

Imperial geologists and astrophysicists are scrutinizing Onon - it is currently in a period of violent geological upheaval.

During the First Imperium, Onon was relatively quiet (geologically speaking), and unsuspecting Vilani colonists settled there.  Three hundred years later, Onon's entire crust shifted, causing a massive outbreak of vulcanism around the globe.  The colony was utterly wiped out - all that remains are some scant tech level 9 ruins.

The world's geologic history in the centuries since has been unstable at best.  Onon has been and still is a favorite research ground for the more planetologists.
