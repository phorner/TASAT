Protalus

The homeworld and power base of Baron Rolf von Toerbach, the famous rebel leader of the Interstellar Confederacy.  Protalus is a vassal state to Marsus, one parsec away, today.  There is little of importance in the system except for an Imperial Naval Base.  Protalus is rarely visited and many consider it an unimportant backwater.
