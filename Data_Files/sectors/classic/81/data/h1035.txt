Okefir

Both Okefir and its neighbor Vala (1034) have been owned by Aursis since their colonization in 57.  Vala remains somewhat backward and dependent on Aursian technology, but Okefir has begun to progress; a rebellion has been stirring there for about 30 years.   Laws imposed by Aursis have become progressively more stringent; some efforts have been made to lure or force the best minds of the planet away.
