The world has no inhabitants other than Navy personnel.

The Imperial Navy Base here is hard at work on a self-aware starship project.  While only a ground-based prototype has been produced, the project's technicians hope that an independently intelligent interstellar vehicle will be produced by the end of this century; partial application of the technology, such as safer navigation and more accurate ship-to-ship combat, should come much sooner.
