Sabsee

The Imperial Naval Base on Sabsee has reportedly been conducting research into high-tech personal weapons for decades.  recently, a highly advanced fusion-plasma weapon similar to the FGMP-15 was unveiled.  Dubbed the FGMP-16, the weapon is considerably smaller and lighter than its earlier counterpart, but every bit as lethal.
