Castell

Castell's surface is over 90% water; its ocean floors abound with metal and mineral wealth.  In 758, negligence by the popula-tion of the Myteria-seru undersea arcology caused it to be completely flooded during the a seismic disturbance, killing all 1.5 million inhabitants.  The government decided that it must carefully control all facets of life in the arcologies to prevent such a disaster from ever occurring again.  The present-day government continues to promote this philosophy.
