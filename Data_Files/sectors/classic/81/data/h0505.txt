Trokusian

Offworlders may travel through the orbital star-port, which Trokusian considers to be extraterritorial.  However, Trokusian requires offworlders to purchase an array of permits to be allowed to travel to the down port on the world's surface.

Trokusian is a tiny desert world; its 75 million inhabitants live mainly in cast ironite dwellings, conditioned and sealed against the harsh conditions on the surface.  The world's exports include ironite (a plaster with metal-like properties) and many varieties of natural crystals.

The Grand Marquis Trenz Rugar, the current ruler, is the most recent in a long line of dictators whose word is law on the world.  The military police forces see to it that the populace obeys the current ruler's laws to the letter.
