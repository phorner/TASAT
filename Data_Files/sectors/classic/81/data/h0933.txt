Hudmill

Naval and Scout facilities are split between orbital bases around Hudmill and a few low-lying islands in the temperate zone of Hudmill's surface.  The few permanent residents are mostly retired officers and their families, who decided to occupy one of the islands the Navy wasn't using.  Climate and lifestyle here are reminiscent of Polynesia on Terra, but civilian offworlders are nor encouraged to stay.
