The government is another inefficient bureaucracy, but the world's landscape is an attractive one.  Tall towers shoot up from the ground, and then, at heights anywhere to from 30 to 100 meters up, they spread out like mushrooms, drooping down toward the ground.  Over time, the structures do eventually reach the ground, forming an enclosed dome under which terraforming can be performed.

On some towers, several domes spread out from different levels, creating concentric circles on the ground.  Different areas of a complex can thus be used for different purposes, with farming in one, manufac-turing in another, and recreation in a third.  Since livable ground under the domes are precious, many inhabitants still live in the towers themselves or in the attached "ceilings" of the domes.
