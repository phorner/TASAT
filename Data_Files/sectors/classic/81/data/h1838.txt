Bellham

Some Solomani call the world "Bedlam."  The inhabitants are the only humans of the Imperium who intuitively understand the K'kree herd instinct, because their planetary culture allows no privacy at all.  A desire to be alone for any purpose whatsoever is looked on as pathological.

The climate, subtropical year-round in the settled areas, encourages the free-style architecture, without walls or doors, which the inhabitants prefer.  Visitors naturally find this very trying, and usually try to retreat to their ships when they wish to have privacy.  Even stranger than the absence of walls and doors in the architecture is the absence of discretion in speech.  Bellhamites are taught from birth to say anything and everything that they are thinking or feeling.  Not only is a gathering of Bellhamites cacophonous, but tact is virtually unknown.

This culture has not made Bellhamites popular away from their own world, either, but they care very little about that.  Few Bellhamites understand the concept of tact.  Apparently conditioned by the barrage from their fellow citizens, Bellhamites seem to have very "thick skins", and often fail to notice other people's hurt feelings.

Bellham's tech level has been steadily decreas-ing since it was first catalogued.  Some researchers maintain that privacy is necessary for creative thought and warn that Bellham will continue to go downhill if a new cultural influence does not gain ascendancy.
