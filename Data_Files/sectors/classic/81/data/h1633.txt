Gandar

The moon of the only gas giant in this small system.  Its low gravity makes it an ideal jump-off point for skimming the gas giant and storing the refined fuel.  There are no other habitable planets, and this one is no prize.

The Salo Merchant Line from Zimmel (1733, one jump away) colonized Gandar as a fueling station.  The Zimmel government eventually took over management of the station and helped make it into a self-sufficient colony, trading fuel and some refined minerals for other needed items.
