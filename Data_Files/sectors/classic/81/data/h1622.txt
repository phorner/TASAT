Heraldia

A small desert world, Heraldia's atmosphere was irrevocably tainted by nearly a century of raids and battles fought between the Sylean Federation and the Interstellar Confederacy (c. -201 to -100).  Prior to this time, the surface was livable, with a thin atmosphere and a 13% hydrosphere.

Since the Sylean Expansion Wars, the remaining inhabitants of the world have been forced to survive in protective domes and underground structures, away from the blazing solar radiation.  The current inhabitants of Heraldia are particularly proud of their battle-scarred past.
