Mirror

Mirror, owned by Ling Standard Products, derives its name from the mirage creating effects of its atmosphere - which is rich in hydrogen sulfide, as is the ocean.  Purified sulphur is a major export.  Indeed, the processes used to extract the sulphur leave behind water, so the planet is gradually becoming more livable by being commercially exploited.
