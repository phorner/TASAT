Marsus

One of the more powerful worlds of the old Interstellar Confederacy, Marsus was known for its main planetary export: mercenary soldiers.  Controlled by the government corporation Marsian Mercenaries, Unlimited, Marsus supplied troops to the highest bidder for any purpose.

Operations were very profitable until the Marsian government chose to fight on the wrong side in the Confederacy Civil War.  The planet's population has steadily declined since then: the current population is only one-tenth of what it was in the first four centuries of the Interstellar Confederacy.
