Dezik

A cold, sub-gas-giant circling a small star. Despite its hydrogen atmosphere, it has a water hydrosphere which is frozen on top  and kept liquid underneath by the planet's own heat. This star system is judged to be a very young one and planets are still contracting and sweeping up asteroid debris.

This unparalleled opportunity to study from the processes of planet formation brought the original scientific colony to Dezik. It has since grown to about 2,500 sophonts from several cooperating races. The scientists remain in charge  of the colony, although many of the inhabitants are now engaged in life support services and other businesses.
