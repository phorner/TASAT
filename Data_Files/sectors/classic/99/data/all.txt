Massilia is an old and well-established sector with a heavy Terran influence in its cultures. Technological progress has been rapid on most planets, and regression to pre-industrial levels is non-existent. Twenty-four worlds scattered evenly through the sector are at tech level 16. Thus, virtually any world can trade for highly advanced items such as the first artificially intelligent robots, global terraforming equipment, pocket holovideo recorders, or neural stun weapons. These last are becoming favorite police weapons on high-tech weapons, since they allow capture without injury and can be safely used even in hostage situations.

Some of these items are terribly expensive, but this is no deterrent to large shipping corporations cutting deals. Buyers elsewhere will pay even higher prices for the best merchandise.
