Gasha

This cold desert planet is the location of the Yamashi Research Institute. The Institute colonized here in 453 to study the Ilraiki race and its evolutionary adaptation to this planet as it grew colder. The climatic change was caused by an increase in its orbital diameter due to the near passage of another star.

Astronomical calculations place the star only one-half light year from Gasha's primary approximately 150,000 years ago. This close passage disturbed the course of both suns and their attendant planets to such an extent that the systems are proving a valuable laboratory in the study of adaptive evolution.

The Ilraiki, Intelligent minor race native to Gasha, are being studied by the Yamashi Research Institute . The Institute colonised Gasha in 453 to study the Ilraiki race and its evolutionary adaptation to this planet as it grew colder. The climatic change was caused by an increase in its orbital diameter due to the near passage of another star.
