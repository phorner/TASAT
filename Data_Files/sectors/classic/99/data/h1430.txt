The Geonee, intelligent minor race of humaniti, are developed from human stock deposited on Shiwonee by the Ancients. The Geonee are a short, stocky, and very muscular race. Their average height is about 1.5 m and their average weight is about 65 kg.

The Geonee were originally thought to be a major race, because they had jump drive when first discovered by the Vilani some 10,000 years ago. However, it was later determined that their development of jump drive was based on a recovered Ancient starship rather than true racial efforts.

Despite the archeological evidence, the Geonee dispute their current classification and hold the (unshared) view that they are of major race standing. In fact, they believe themselves to be the Ancients, and therefore were using their own vessel to regain spaceflight. There are three reasons for this. First, the Geonee had one of the highest tech levels of all the races discovered by the Vilani. Second, Geonee legends and "memories" tell of a time when the race travelled among the stars until a great war. Third, the Geonee Cultural Region contains some of the most extensive sets of Ancients ruins known, including facilities that were obviously set up for humans. The word "Geonee" means "old ones", and is itself a very old term for the inhabitants of the Region.

Some of the richest Ancient sites have been discovered near the Geonee homeworld, and there is an old legend that the Imperial Navy once recovered an entire Ancient starship, the Bradeeva. The Geonee attempted to sue the Imperium for its theft, but the case was dismissed.
