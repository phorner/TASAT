This world, though beautiful and varied, would not have its present volume of traffic and tourism were it not for the Iilodav Music Festival. Performers and performing groups come from all over the Imperium to study and perform here.

Hallow's performance facilities are superb, and the Meinel Conservatory has a library of music that many claim is unequaled within the Imperium. Here you can find and hear compositions ranging from the ancient Kilatis' of Baarid Garuud and the Claconas and Fugues of Dietrich Bixtehude to the most modern compositions of Bran Ralu, Eafeahkhail Eeskha, and Robin Garcia. There are even occasional performances of the music and drama of droyne, Hiver, Vargr, and non-Imperial Aslan cultures.
