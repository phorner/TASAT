The inhabitants have no government and want none; indeed, they can see no use for a government under any circumstance. No decision is ever taken collectively; each chooses for himself, independent of whether he consults with others or not. There is no army, no police force, no foreign ministry; off-worlders deal directly with the people they wish to see and need answer to no officials.
