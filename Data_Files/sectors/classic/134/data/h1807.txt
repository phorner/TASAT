Clown has two widely separated colonies that rarely deal with each other. When originally colonized, two colonies were established: one in the north polar ice cap region and one in the south polar ice region. No other location had any water, so population spread was not encouraged. The two simply dug in and grew right where they were. Today, both colonies are still totally self-sufficient and self-governing. The subsector offices are located in Popov, on the north polar cap.
