Ziarko is a mystery to most visitors.  A nearly barren vacuum world boasts
an excellent starport with ultramodern facilities and a fairly heavy
traffic in vessels without being on a Confederation trade route.  Besides
all of that, there are very few full-time residents of the planet; these
being the staff of the starport!

The only thing that can be found on Ziarko are orange-colored Jakaso
crystals, and it is against Ziarko law to gather any of these crystals.
