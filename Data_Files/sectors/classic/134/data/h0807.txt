Nova Dune's harsh conditions require its inhabitants to wear desert
clothing and filter mask/respirators.  There are only two hundred
inhabitants, all adherents of the exiled Baron Atheker.  The Baron still
wears his families crest and flies the Imperium flag over his base,
although the Imperium views him a traitor.  The Solomani tolerate his
presence because no-one else has asked to colonize this inhospitable
world.-- Dakin Burdick (9/96)
