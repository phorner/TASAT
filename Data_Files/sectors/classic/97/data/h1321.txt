Shagipka:
	  Lying only three parsecs from Dlan, it was one of the first worlds to which Dulinor directed his attention. Shagipka received word of the assassination within a week of its release on Dlan. At the same time, Dulinor established controls on the news stories carried on the xboat network, effectively precluding anyone on Shagipka from hearing differing views. Shagipka's civil service bureaucracy was already accustomed to receiving notifications, orders, and instructions from Dulinor as a member of the Imperial nobility. His statements to the government now carried with them a ring of authority; at the same time, Dulinor's cutoff of opposing views made it difficult for the government to actively oppose him.
Dulinor's campaign also made it clear to the government that there was no clear alternative to accepting him. Fleet maneuvers showed that Dulinor controlled all naval forces in the region. Dulinor instituted a small levy on goods imported to Shagipka and ordered that a tax stamp with his likeness and the words "Emperor Dulinor I" be attached to every incoming shipment. The bureaucracy incorporated the procedure into its own list of procedures, and almost naturally accepted the transition from Strephon to Dulinor. The population was not presented with a choice so much as an accomplished fact.
