
Shunim is a colony of Shagipka, lying two parsecs away. Dulinor's campaign on Shunim exploited his previously acquired control of Shagipka to extend his circle of power. Because Shagipka already accepted Dulinor, it was a natural process to assign the Shagipkan bureaucracy the task of assuring Shunim's loyalty to Dulinor.
The major emphasis on Shunim rested on Dulinor's basic thesis, stating that the Imperium should do more for the individual worlds of the Imperium. For Shunim, this struck a responsive chord with its promises of more attention to the needs of the people. At the same time, the restriction on incoming information made it nearly impossible for any opposing views to be considered on the world. Dulinor gained the upper hand by shutting off the competition before it could start. [Rebellion Sourcebook]
