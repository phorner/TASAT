Dulinor's home world of Dlan is ruled by a religious dictatorship. Dlan's religion is known as Virasa, from the Vilani world "discovery". The religion holds that a knowledge of God is impossible during one's normal life, and discussion of whether God exists or what his attributes might be are strictly prohibited. Despite this professed ignorance of God, the Virasins do have extensive beliefs in an afterlife, and its  comforts and mode of existence are regular topics of discussions in the quarterly khanu (foreshadowing) meetings.

Believers are taught that they will receive complete knowledge of all things in this paradisiacal existence, giving the religion its name of "discovery". Non-humans will not receive this special blessing, and on Dlan alien races must wear black clothing as a symbol of this unfortunate status. Human non-believers number about 20% of Dlan's population, and they must also wear all-black clothing. Dulinor himself and his family members dress entirely in black, belonging to the non-believing population of the world.

The Dlani government rules believers and non-believers by different laws, but the differences apply principally to allowed occupations and taxes. Virasa teaches that those who die a violent death will not achieve the full state of knowledge in the afterlife, and so Dlan's extensive military forces and police services are staffed almost entirely by non-believers. Seeing a brigade of grav soldiers approaching in jet black uniforms is an ominous sight.

As a general rule, non-believers  tend not to travel as much as believers, since Virasa requires a natural death on Dlan for the complete knowledge in the afterlife. Because of this, most traders and representatives from Dlan tend to be non-believers, who dress entirely in black and have a more militant attitude than even the rest of the world's inhabitants. A person "as mad as a Dlani" is avoided by all, in the popular speech of those Ilelish Sector.
