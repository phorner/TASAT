Malorn contains several Solomani and Aslan colonies, many Non-Aligned, and features several smaller interstellar polities, including the Bright Star Cooperate, Creation of Nonpareil, Daprolix Juncture of Suns, Great Terbah, Joie De Vivre, Lords of Vision, Malorn Union, Parity of Brothers, Theocracy of Weltschmerz, and the Toh Republic. 
The parasitic Valkyrie are a Minor Race thought to have originated far rimward of the Aslan Hierate and Solomani Sphere. Their society is a single, all-encompassing order known as the Dominion, currently located somewhere in Malorn Sector. The Valkyrie are believed to have absorbed at least four and possibly over a dozen Solomani and Aslan colony worlds. They are also known to have exterminated one entire alien species, the chlorine-breathing Kai-Nal.
