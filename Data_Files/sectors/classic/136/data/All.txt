Alpha Crucis sector is located directly to trailing of the Solomani Rim. The majority of this sector lies within the Solomani Confederation but two entire subsectors and sections of three others were captured by the Imperium in the Solomani Rim War.

These worlds remain under Imperial occupation. Active Solomani guerrilla movements supported by factions in the Solomani Confederation have prevented their full integration into Imperial society. The presence of many non-aligned worlds and the nationalistic aspirations of former pre-Solomani Confederation states further complicate sector politics.
