Sky Raiders

Name given to a semi-legendary culture which seems to have fluorished some 5,300 years ago in the Far Frontiers sector. Almost all evidence of the Sky Raiders has come from oral traditions, myths, legends, and the like from a number of separate worlds in the Jungleblut and Taemerlyk subsectors. Their origin, fate, and details of their culture remain unknown. Evidence gathered thus far, particularly on Mirayn, has proven that the Sky Raiders were of human stock (race at present uncertain), enjoying a Tech 9-10 civilization and employing the Vilani language. 

Tradition invariably depicts the Sky Raiders as a ruthless, agressive race, descending from the sky to spread destruction and death among the inhabitants. Plunder and pillage would seem to have been their main object in these raids. A number of theories have circulated regarding their origins; the popular theory put forward by by Professor Jothan Messandi identifying them with the inhabitants of Mirayn/Jungleblut has been completely disproved by the discoveries on that world made by his daughter, Lorain Messandi. 

Recent doscoveries by Lorain Messandi and other scientists at the Institute for System Studies have shown the Sky Raiders to have been the descendants of the Loeskalth culture who fled from the Vilani expansion 5,400 years ago on an asteroid generation ship equipped for both sublight and interstellar travel.
