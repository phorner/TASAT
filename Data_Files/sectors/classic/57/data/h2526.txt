Shadowsand is a ring of many small worldlets (planetoids AKA an "asteroid belt"), not capable of retaining an atmosphere or water, and nonindustrial in nature. These worldlets warrant hazardous environment precautions. Life in a vacuum requires great discipline. After all, it only takes one forgotten seal on a vacuum suit to spell death. Those who survive tend to be very methodically-minded and attentive to small detail. The worldlets require extensive imports of outside technology to maintain a modern, star-faring society. Having to import most manufactured and high tech goods drives the price up for these items at this world. Because of the enormous energies released by the nova, Shadowsand has been mined heavily in the last fifteen years since the discovery there of eka-metals, super-heavymetals with very unusual and unique properties. 

In 1094, the Chalq Dhamon rebels commandeered mining operations there considered vital to the success of Genem Inc.'s freepoint armor projects for fourteen months before being destroyed by several contingents of Protectorate Marines.

This world contains a black hole instead of a primary star. The astrophysical properties of a world in a stable orbit around a black hole are not well understood. Some even conjecture that this world's orbit is not stable in the long-term.
