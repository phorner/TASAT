  This information was laboriously (HAH!) keyed in by Jeff Zeitlin.  The
  following sources provided valuable assistance in the complete development
  of this sector:

           _Atlas_of_the_Imperium_, Game Designers' Workshop (1984)
                provided star locations and partial UWP information,
                and names of high-population worlds.

           _Vilani_and_Vargr_, Digest Group Publications (1990), and the
           _Referee's_Gaming_Kit_, Digest Group Publications (1989)
                provided background information on the Vilani and
                on the history of the settlement and development of
                Vilani and Imperial space, the arrangement of polities,
                and the general character of Imperial space.

           Several computer utilities were written in Euphoria to
                generate the world names not supplied by the other
                sources.  These utilites were run on a Toshiba
                Satellite T1950CT laptop computer.  These utilities
                are available (with complete source) on request to
                jeff.zeitlin@mail.execnet.com.
