Notes on Fornast Sector
-----------------------
Fornast Sector was never fully developed by GDW or DGP (and any development
that may have been done by Paranoia Press or Judges' Guild has since been
declared non-canonical), although GDW did map out this sector in the
_Atlas_of_the_Imperium_ (1984).  In the Imperium Games release of 
_Marc_Miller's_Traveller_, it was declared that this sector, as well as
Delphi and Zarushagar sectors, would not be developed, and left as referee's
preserves.  The information here was taken from the published information
from the _Atlas_, and developed independently.  Its canonicity should therefore
be considered low at best; the _Atlas_ provided only the names of high
population worlds, the locations and starport ratings of all worlds, an 
indicator of which worlds were desert worlds, polity membership for worlds not 
in the Imperium (there were none in this sector), and identification of the
locations and types of bases in the sector.  All the rest is simply plausible
(I hope) development rooted in my fertile (or is that toxically contaminated?)
imagination.
