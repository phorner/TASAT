Langere Sector (Imperial coordinates 2/-4) is located Rimward of Spica Sector and Trailing of Neworld Sector. The Hive Federation controls most of the Sector, including all of subsectors C, D, F, G, H, and L and parts of subsectors B, E, J, K, O, and P. The Solomani Confederation controls subsector A and parts of subsectors B and E. The balance of the subsector is made up of individual Non-Aligned worlds. Langere is closely involved in trade with the Confederation, the Hive Federation, and with independent worlds and pocket empires on the Confederation’s trailing border. 
To the Confederation, Langere is a frontier sector and includes several new colony worlds as well as Solomani client states that border on the Federation. A noteworthy Confederation member-state, the Hanuman Systems, is located in Langere. 

Although there are some disputes between Solomani and Hiver proxy states and a recent rise of piracy, there is no military conflict. The Solomani-Hiver contest in the sector has instead taken the form of diplomatic and economic rivalry to gain the affections of non-aligned worlds. 

The Confederation's Neworld Sector Fleet is responsible for the defense of Solomani worlds in Langere.
