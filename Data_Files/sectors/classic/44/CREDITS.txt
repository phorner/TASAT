Windhorn Sector - Credits
-------------------------

The Windhorn Sector data was created by John G. Wood.  Star positions were taken (as closely as possible) from
the dot map in Vilani & Vargr, as were allegiances; subsector names come from Steve Bonneville's
consolidated list generated by john wood.  His web page for this is at http://www.elvw.demon.co.uk/Traveller/Sectors/Windhorn.html
