The Droyne on Oudzkharz (1828) are kept confined to 1 small continent 
by the Vargr. Having no starships of their own, all offworld contact 
is through the Vargr. Besides their physical isolation, the Droyne
infrastructure is isolated from the Vargr as well. The Droyne also do 
not share the same technological level (7 as opposed to 11) as the 
Vargr. Despite this, interracial relations are fairly good. There is 
even a fair amount of trade.
