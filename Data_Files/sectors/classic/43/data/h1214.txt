Kaegrogz (1214) is a regional capital for the Empire of Varroerth. 
Several corsairs are allowed to operate in the area on behalf of 
Kaegrogz and the other Empire of Varroerth worlds. They've teamed up 
with the Windhorn Alliance for raids on Corridor. They aren't above 
attacking other corsairs and the Irrgh Manifest either.
