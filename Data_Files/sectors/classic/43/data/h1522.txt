The Church of the Chosen Ones have ruled Foedargh (1522) with an iron 
fist. None dare to oppose the Church. Off-worlders who are found to be 
participating in activities that countermand the Church are arrested. 
The people do not get to enjoy the fruits of their labors (hence TL5). 
The commodities they manufacture are exported. Profits are used to 
build great temples and purchase equipment and weapons that strengthen 
the Church's control.
