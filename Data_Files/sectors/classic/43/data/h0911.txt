Ozkhakhstoul (0911) started out as Roughhaks, a vacation resort for 
the wealthy citizens of the various nations of Ozkhakh (0912). It was 
an independent world owned by the corporation that ran the global 
resort. Several politicians, representing the 8 largest nations of 
Ozkhakh, convinced their governments that Ozkhakh could profit if they 
took over the resort world. And that's what they did. Without having 
to fire a shot, the united military forces of Ozkhakh moved in and 
declared that the resort world was now the property of Ozkakh. The 
world was thus renamed Ozkhakhstoul.
