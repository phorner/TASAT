Taarskoerzn (1835) is the capital of the Glory of Taarskoerzn, a state
which only consisted of 7 member worlds prior to 1116. Jealous of their
rivals, the Irrgh Manifest, they enlisted the aid of corsairs to go 
against them. The Church of the Chosen Ones provided moral support to 
their cause. In 1116, they plowed their way into Corridor, splitting 
the Irrgh Manifest in two. Riding high on their success, they began 
plotting the next phase of their expansion. They were caught by 
surprise when a united fleet of corsairs overwhelmed Depot. As a result, 
they soon found themselves taking orders rather then giving them.
