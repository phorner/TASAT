The isolation of Togikhtsurzall (2116), even from the other Windhorn 
worlds, has helped to foster stagnation and decay within the 
infrastructure. Originally, it served as a home for idealists who 
established a direct democracy so that everyone's voice could be heard. 
It worked for a while but soon social outcasts of a different sort 
(criminals pretending to be victims of politics) wound up here. Their 
numbers quickly rose to become the majority. As the crime rate rose, 
the idealists saw the writing on the wall and moved on. Some wound up 
at Naeztir and decided to handle things differently.
