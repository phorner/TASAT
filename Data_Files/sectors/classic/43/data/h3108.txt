Uedh Kal (3108), owned by the company of the same name, serves as a 
reverse engineering/research institute. Although only legally permitted 
to deal with the Empire, the owners realized that a diversified client 
base was much more preferrable. As such, they trade with regional 
governors in the Empire as well as corsairs and other interstellar 
states.
