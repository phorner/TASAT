Garogag (2839) was a balkanized world for centuries. Priests from the
Church of the Chosen Ones somehow managed to unite the people under a
single government, them. They have been fairly strict and after a 
couple of decades prohibited viewpoints that disagreed with the Church. 
Visitors should exercise caution and make no effort to draw attention 
to themselves. Although visitors are welcome to Garogag, their actions 
could be misconstrued as hostile to the Church.
