Knunguegaegn (421), an industrial world, is run by a conservative
(detractors say rigid) council which believes that strict discipline 
is the proper way to run their world and the workplace. Based on their 
economic prosperity, the strategy appears successful. The council 
enjoys the overwhelming confidence of its citizens.
