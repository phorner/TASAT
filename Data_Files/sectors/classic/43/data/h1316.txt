Igzinghuell (1316) is a world ruled by the Church of the Chosen Ones. 
They've enjoyed the support of the people as they seem to truly have 
the welfare of the people in mind. They reached TL 10 in 1109 and then 
decided to spread the Word of the Church to others. Their first, and 
only, conquest was Vifueks (1317) in 1115, which was renamed 
Igzinghuellstoul. Pleased by their initial success, they set out to 
take Lloedh (1217) in 1118. They were defeated by joint Lloedh and 
Koenalor (1117) forces. This joint force went on to liberate Vifueks 
and then humble Igzinghuell. The naval base was seriously damaged and 
the world was bombed from orbit. Rather than finishing the job, the 
Lloedh-Koenalor task force returned home. The humiliation angered the 
Church but the High Priest decided that perhaps a path of peace was 
more appropriate. His popularity has waned within the ranks of the 
Akufar (the name of the body of high level clergy) who want revenge. 
The High Priest was recently assassinated by a bomb explosion. The 
Akufar are suspected of planting the bomb but they blame the attack on 
terrorists backed by Lloedh and Koenalor. The newly appointed High 
Priest avows revenge.
