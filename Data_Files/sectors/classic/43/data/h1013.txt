As the corsair outpost at Llurang (1013) has begun to thrive, it has 
spawned various service industries: Food, Entertainment, Healthcare, 
Starship Maintenance, etc. Without any central authority to manage 
operations, equity of services has varied considerably. This is 
reflected in the tech level 6 rating. In some instances, available 
technology reaches 9 and even 10.
