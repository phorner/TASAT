At least two Terran settlements were established in Canopus by -2204, both far outside the borders of the Terran Confederation. One was located in subsector G, while the other was located in subsector I. 

Parts of Canopus were unexplored until the last century and some worlds remain largely unknown. Commercial interest in Magyar and Aldebaran Sector was renewed in the last half-century. Land-hungry Aslan clans from Ustral Quadrant have also attempted to colonize worlds in what is ostensibly Solomani Confederation territory, which has resulted in sporadic border conflicts between Confederation and Aslan Hierate vessels.


Canopus sector was home to the Gamopedes, a peaceful Minor Race that had been classified by the Confederation as primitive indigenous aliens. The native Gamopedes were not successfully assimilated into Solomani society: they failed to adapt to a high-technology lifestyle and stopped reproducing altogether.
