Gniivi A nonhuman, minor alien race spanning the Hinterworlds - Leonidae border, the Gniivi use their jump-2 capable ships to maintain their 23-world state. Though engaging in trade with nearby client states--the Imperium, the Solomani, the Two Thousand Worlds, and the Hive Federation--the Gniivi are fiercely protective of their independence. 

A race of large, long-lived creatures, the Gniivi's expansion has been slow and deliberate - growing only when resources allow. 

Recently, there have been reports that the Gniivi may be linked to commercial raiding in the sector's core, but their governing body adamantly denies such charges, claiming the Gniivi would see no benefit from such ventures. "Large, long-lived creatures," "slow and deliberate" with 3 subsectordomain at trailing edge of Hinterworlds. (See Challenge 39)
