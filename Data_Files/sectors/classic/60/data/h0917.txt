Kubishush

The planet circles at the outer edge of their star's habitable zone. Temperature averages -40C and has a nitrogen atmosphere at 6.1 atmospheres pressure, with ammonia oceans and ammonia vapor in the air along with a geologically active terrain. The inhabitants are a hermaphroditic septapodal minor race, the Gl'lu, whose metabolism is based on oxidation of the atmosphere's ammonia. Their latest leader, S'lmar Vovon, a dynamic Sananes (young one) brilliantly led the rescue and reorganization efforts in the most recent of the planet's geological upheavals. Rebuilding has progressed so rapidly under his (or her) guidance and the expertise of the planet's engineers that few visitors today can see the scars of the latest turmoil.


The Gl'lu, Intelligent minor race native to Kubishush, are a hermaphroditic species sporting four arms and three legs on their stout bodies. Crowning their heads are three eye stalks. Oxidation of the ammonia in the air drives their metabolism.
