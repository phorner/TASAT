Morninglori

A peaceful agricultural world. Population divided between five cities and GloriDown starport, all linked by a high-speed rail network. The military keeps a steady pace.

Inhabitants adjust to the short rotation period by staying awake for two days and sleeping for one. This means that most businesses are manned at most hours by workers from one shift or another.

There are two continents; Delhiha, by far the largest and home to 100% of the population, and Termiala, a small "island continent" left unexplored and unsettled. The surface is covered with either fertile green fields and forests, or dark blue oceans.
