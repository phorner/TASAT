Dawn

Dawn gets its name from its spectacular fluorescent sunrises and sunsets, caused by the argon and neon atmospheric taint. No land at all breaks Dawn's watery surface. Since colonization, two entirely different cultures have developed; some 170,000 people inhabit the orbital starport, while the other 250,000 live as nomads on the planet in thousands of free-floating Makranii, or ship-cities. Few official ties exist between the two cultures.
