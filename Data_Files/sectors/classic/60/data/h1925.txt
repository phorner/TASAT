Deneb

This sector's capital world orbits a bright, blue star. It has a dense atmosphere tainted with the by-products of its extensive worldwide industrialization. Of the system's six billion inhabitants, nearly one billion live elsewhere in the system, in various planetary or moon-based cities.

Technicians are the ruling class of the world. They are distinct from the Duke of Deneb, and imperial official and head of the Sector Government. The local government of Deneb must answer to the Duke on Imperial matters.
