Wal-ta-ka

A tidally-locked world. Estin Down is the only starport. A disaster in 234 forced the miners from their protective domes on the bright side. Visiting traders found the mining colony destroyed, and presumed all were dead. When the miner's descendants were discovered 130 years later, they had developed a full-fledged sub-culture with unique customs and a new language descended from Galangic.
