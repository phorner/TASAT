Kiirindor

Kiirindor's atmosphere is tainted with excess carbon dioxide, which warms it pleasantly but makes breathing difficult. The inhabitants cultivate much greenery in and around their homes to offset this. The planet was colonized from Erita (2519) over the past 200 years, and is scheduled for complete independence any time now.
