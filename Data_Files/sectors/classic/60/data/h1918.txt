Shinorasus

Inhabitants came from Namidshur (2019) because of their discontent with its high law level. Many were inventors, technicians, and artisans. They agreed to have little formal government. Their sealed estates are supplied with water and oxygen released from the world's crust. Fuel, repairs, and starships constructed at Shinorasus' starport are known for their high quality and astronomical cost. Offworld visitors are not encouraged to stay for more than a few weeks.
