Exile

The worst criminals of the sector are dumped here with nothing but the clothes on their back. The planet is hospitable to humaniti, but few of the malefactors have the strength, skill, and nerve needed to survive in this artificial stone age.

A stable population of two or three thousand has emerged through ruthless culling; newcomers are well advised to cooperate with whatever leader they fall in with. The system is heavily patrolled by the Navy to prevent would-be rescuers from freeing the dangerous criminals sentenced to live out their lives here.
