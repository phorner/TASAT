Ansirk

Some 20 navy personnel on Ansirk undertake small starship design and construction: several are test pilots. Another 20 to 30 provide basic facilities for the inhabitants and for civilian travellers. The economy is supported by a vast store of refined fuel, scooped from the gas giant which Ansirk orbits. The navy uses the system for test maneuvers -- their presence discourages pirates. Security pilots are commonly armed with FGMP-15s and other efficient weapons.
