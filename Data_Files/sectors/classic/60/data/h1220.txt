Minde's Star

IISS astronomers originally established the outpost at Minde in 269. Located on the system's outermost world - a cold, bleak rock ball - the outpost and its inhabitants have grown. Today, station personnel number over 30,000.

The system's main item of interest - and its namesake - is the primary, a red flare star. Astronomer Jeferson Minde first observed the star's fluctuations in brightness. Minde located a truly unusual astronomical object. The star varies dramatically in brilliance -- in its greatest recorded fluctuation, its luminosity increased sixty-fold in a half-minute. Such fluctuations are sudden and noncyclical.

The Scouts renamed the system for Mindes when the observatory was built. Today, the outpost at Minde's star stands foremost among observatories studying this type of flare star. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the local astronomers' forecasts has increased, benefitting no doubt from the body of data recorded over the outpost's lifetime.
