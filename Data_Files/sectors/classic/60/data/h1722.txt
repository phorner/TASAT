Redemption

One of only three Imperial worlds that enjoy Amber travel code while lacking starport facilities of any kind. This rare status stems from the inhabitant's strange beliefs and evangelistic zeal.

Redemption's native forsook the conveniences of modern technology to follow a back-to-nature life style. While most sects with a similar ideology favor isolation, the people of Redemption are extremely open and friendly. They welcome interstellar trade, but only to bring possible converts.

As independent merchants come to the planet, the natives try to persuade them to scrap their vessels and take up the spartan local existence. This is the course the native's ancestors followed, making crude dwellings from their gutted ships and pursuing their unusual faith.
