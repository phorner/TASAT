System: Antra


   NOTE: due to the Worldroof - built as a major scientific experiment,
   and an implicit example of Imperial power to the Vargr, by order of
   Emperess Porfiria in 271, and finally completed in 883 - and extensive
   weather control (possibly the best in the Galaxy):
     * atmos should be changed to 1.000: thus, the air is breathable
     * TNE Weather changed to +8 (almost always crystal-clear weather,
       sometimes overcast)
     * daily temperature range = -10 noon, -20 midnight (Lowering the
       base temp to 19 degrees, but decreasing the severity of the
       nighttime from -78 to -20)
   
   Antra, its worldroof one of the Seven Wonders of the Imperium, is a
   must for any tourist of Deneb Sector. Despite the long, tedious and
   invading antiViral procedures, Antra still is a busy port of call, for
   its artworks and tourism sites, its vast radioactive mines - the
   largest in 25 parsecs - and its political connections. Still, caution
   is called for when among the xenophobic Antrans, and the beautiful
   towers that support the famed Worldroof rest on some nasty
   foundations...
   
Antiviral Runaround
-------------------
   
   Situated on the very edge of the Regency/Virus border, the incoming
   traveller can expect Trin-level paranoia. And just as well: if for any
   reason Virus enters the system, the 700 million people of Antra are as
   dead as Dulinor.
   
   Any ship filing a direct flight plan to Antra is immediately pointed
   to the nearest Regency Quarantine Office. In cooperation with the
   Antran government, the RQS keeps a set of specific travel routes and
   jump routines controlling movement within the Antran system, which
   vary from time to time. The computer module of flight routine for the
   specific time that the traders intend to be in the system is directly
   plugged into the various computer systems of the ship by RQS
   personnnel, and an RQS officer is posted to the ship for the week's
   trip.
   
   Before leaving for Antra, the ship is carefully checked out by an RQS
   team, taking a day per 100 tons displacement. Everyone is given a
   complete physical examination: no one with artifical inorganic
   enhancements is permitted to continue on the voyage, on pain of death.
   
   When they first arrive from jump the ship follows its pre-computated
   flight plan to a preselected position and vector in space. The RQS
   officer on board must radio for a RQS cutter to meet them, using a
   special one-time code that only the RQS officer on board knows.
   
   NOTE: Antra is within 100 diameters of its primary star: the ship
   leaves jump space between 155 and 355 light-seconds from Antra,
   depending on orbital mechanics, the skill of the pilot, etc. With the
   pre-computed jump co-ordinates, the ship always leaves jump exactly
   opposite of Antra's position, 355 light-seconds away on the other side
   of the star.
   
   Ships that do not conform to the specific flight plan must immediately
   kill their velocity, and come to a dead halt. The people on board must
   put on their space suits and cross over to the RQS cutter. The ship is
   impounded, and usually considered forfeited to the Antran government
   if free of Virus. If the ship is found to be infected, the crew have
   their personalities reconstructed.
   
   Ships that don't come to a stop, for whatever reason, are destroyed.
   
   The cutter boards the ship and an RQS team carefully looks it over for
   Virus. Since this is a lighter team that the previous base-check, it
   only takes a few hours before the ship is underway again, to a nearby
   (usually under 20 light-seconds) RQS space station.
   
   The RQS station - basically an underarmed naval base, designed to take
   on a flotilla of 100 ships of up to 1,000 disp tons each - AGAIN
   checks out the ship for Virus. After about half a day - regardless of
   the size of the ship, the local crew is large, good, well equipped,
   and fast enough to process it in under 12 hours - the ship, without
   its escort but still with its babysitting RQS officer onboard, finally
   heads for Antra.
   
   The ship will be halted again and inspected 10 light seconds from
   Antra, not by an RQS cutter but by a 1,000-6,000 ton SDB.
   

The Worldroof
------------- 

   As you finally approach Antra (at 1G, as per regulations), bathed
   under the dull red light of its star, you start to notice that it
   seems to be largely encased by glass. And when you arrive at the
   Highport - attached to Antra by a 50 km elevator - the vast Worldroof
   of Antra is revealed in all its glory. It covering over 80% of Antra,
   composed by a mosaic of hexagonal "glass" cells suspended in the air
   by 1,774 2km high 'tower groups'. Each 'tower group' is composed of
   seven towers: six towers supports the roof, generates power (via both
   capturing a small percent of the star's radiated energy and the
   200-300 km winds), and provides the best weather control in the
   Regency (or for that matter, in the preCollapse Imperium).
   
   The seventh tower is either an industrial or residential centre.
   Industrial centres were built with 5,000 inhabitants, residential
   centres - basically tower cities, in a style familiar on high-tech
   worlds - hold up to 500,000 people.
   
   No ship ever lands on Antra: the high-atmosphere winds are both fast
   and fickle, continually shifting to equalize the tempertature between
   the dark and light sides of Antra. Also, it's a security measure by
   the Antrans to again insure that Virus doesn't get in. Thus, all
   transport is via the Highport elevator.
   
     REFEREE: Why doesn't the atmosphere flow out of the 20% of the world
     not covered by the Worldroof? Ask the British Interplanetary
     Society: they're the ones who came up with this crazy idea! The
     'high-winds' part is a natural consequence of equalizing the
     temperatures, and moderating the nighttime low to the extent that
     the Antran want to: it should be doable given TL-14 tech.


Arriving on Antra
-----------------

   All people, articles and cargo are completely checked out by local
   antiVirus teams on the Highport, taking another day. (This includes
   medical examinations: no people with ANY artifical inorganic
   enhansements are permitted insystem. If caught in this stage of the
   game, they will be killed.) Another quickie 'make sure' check is made
   before leaving the elevator, and a final antiViral team awaits to
   greet the players just as they step off the 30 minute journey on the
   massive elevator, for another full check of everyone and everything.
   
  
Festival
-------- 

   The first thing everyone does after arrival is look up at the immense
   hexagonal grid over them. Throughout most of the year, you'll only see
   a crystal clear, cloudless sky, faintly outlined with hundreds of
   hexagons. In the nighttime, the outlines glow faintly red: but that is
   all.
   
   But, if you arrived during the two-week Blazing Lights Festival, you'd
   see some fantastic pattern of lights and graphics in the sky,
   surpassing anything you may have seen in a VR tube. These Festivals
   have become more and more ornate since the Collapse, now including
   sounds and wind patterns specifically created for the artist,
   generated by the weather control system (imagine immense, organ-like
   sounds emanating from the roof and the winds: absolutely
   overwhelming).
   
   Of course, tickets for Antra tends to skyrocket as the Festival nears:
   not offically, of course, but the cost in bribes and favours can get
   very severe. Regardless of the offically fixed passenger prices
   (rumour has it that, even in the Wilds, they haven't changed a bit!),
   you only see the best and the wealthiest arrive on Antra in time for
   the Festival.
   
   Festival serves not only as the premiere social event of the
   subsector, but as one of five or six events of sector-wide reputation,
   and thus a location where Things Happen and media attention is
   guaranteed. Archduke Norris, for example, formally announced the
   engagement of his daughter on Antra.


Attitude toward Visitors
------------------------

   Despite the waves of visitors to Antra, despite their standing as a
   subsector capital, and despite their A-class port, Antrans are
   intensely xenophobic. They detest foreigners who don't fit into their
   ways, or don't understand their arts. Usually, this loathing is
   displayed by rudeness or by mocking the ignorance of visitors. The
   more upper-class folk will tend to prefer to use a biting wit, or
   cruel puns. The lower class Antrans prefer a more direct approach:
   never giving a visitor the benefit of the doubt, shouting down any
   attempt to offer an opinion, or a light beating if a visitor gets too
   uppity. Visitors being raped and killed in certain neighbourhoods
   after dark is not unknown.
   
   But vying head to head with this xenophobia is a great fear and
   respect for large organizations. The Antrans are very aware of how
   close they are to joining a thousand dead worlds, and how badly they
   need the protection of the Regency government. Thus, often they deny
   their unwarranted actions, or say that it's just a joke, or otherwise
   try to soothe the waters. Their comedies often revolve on how to make
   a fool of visitors, how to hurt them savagely, and yet have the
   visitors still love you.
   
   Traders should be cautious here: some friction is inevitable, and many
   routine liasion tasks need to be increased one difficulty level.
   Always be aware that much of the hostility that Antrans feel towards
   you is simply cultural, and can be handled with finesse - or even
   turned into an advantage - if you know what you are doing.
   
   Also be aware that they do not so much want to kill you has to
   humiliate you, to wound your pride without being hurt in return. Some
   traders are good enough, and have enough leverage, that they can fight
   head-to-head with the Antrans. Most - including almost all free
   traders, who are always a cargo-load away from disaster - simply have
   to take it, in order to get that cargo you need.
   
   Sorry: the law level of this world does not allow you to carry any
   weapons off the ship - although at least they don't impound them
   off-ship.


Immigrants
----------

   Of course, not all starship traffic is related to the Festival. After
   Virus was halted at Catacomb and Deneb, (and several small, sharp
   battles were fought right here) Antra found itself not only having to
   rebuid from Vargr pillaging and stupid stunts (more than one Vargr
   corsair met its end on the Worldroof, weakening its integrity), but
   also having to rewire everything to meet anti-Viral spec's. Also,
   Antra made very heavy use of robots: without them, Antra simply
   couldn't meet the demands that rebuilding made.
   
   In the end, Antra - which prides itself on tight population control -
   had to allow massive immigration to provide a workforce. The
   population rose from 500 million to 700 million, almost all from
   immigration from nearby Uakari (Antra: Deneb/1710 C5349AA-7). These
   immigrants are loathed by native Antrans, and considered low-brow,
   low-tech thugs. They are not permitted to bring any family, and
   workers who get pregnant are given the choice of leaving or having an
   abortion: if they stay, a one-time contraceptive is administered to
   insure sterility, with an antidote given when the working women leave.
   
   Despite the fact that they are paid ten times the amount they would
   earn back home, unrest festers in the shantytowns of Antra, kept near
   the industrial towers and far from the tower cities where Antrans
   live. The immigrants hate the veiled (or, often, completly open)
   contempt and hatred they are held in by the xenophobic Antrans, who
   believe that they are doing the Uakari an unmerited, and unthanked,
   favour.
   
   The immigrants - refered to as "visiting workers" by upper-class
   Antrans, "thugees" by lower-class Antrans, and "toilers" by themselves
   - are hired on one, five, or ten-year workterms, with a continous flow
   of about 2 million people either entering or leaving Antra (keeping
   over 40,000 subsidized liners employed). The immigrant workforce has
   been in decline for the last 20 years, and now make up 170 million
   people: native born Antrans and non-computerized machinery have been
   slowly squeezing them out, and the immigrant workforce is predicted to
   be all gone in 20 years.


Religion
--------

   When the first survey ships arrived from Corridor, there were a series
   of enigmatic, artificial lines and curves on the earth. Etched out in
   black stone, and often half a mile wide, they can be seen from low
   orbit.They do definitely make out patterns, but no one has ever
   managed to successfuly translate them.
   
   No one knows who made these lines, or can even guess how old they are,
   but the Black Lines are a major factor in the many local beliefs. The
   largest local religions insists that the lines were made from an
   ancient civilization, trying to tell Antran - who, of all the people
   of the universe, have alone been blessed with the Lines - the secrets
   of the universe.
   
   Equally dominant in Antran philosophy is evolution, but as a doctrine
   rather than a scientific theory. This doctrine - never formally
   organized, it has no offical name, but commonly called the Promethians
   - most believe that humaniti, even postCollapse humaniti, is marching
   on to a higher goal, continually evolving themselves to spread their
   genes and power throughout the Universe.
   
   The Black Liners believe that other human civilizations have
   transcended this universe millions of years ago, and that current
   humaniti (including the Zhos, Vilani, and Solomani) are simply walking
   on a well-trod path. While they certainly don't believe in the God of
   the Solomani monotheists, they do believe that there is a guiding
   Spirit of Humaniti over all, and that a glorious unity of souls awaits
   us after death.
   
   The Promethians, in contrast, does not care for such a soft-headed
   concept as a sweet afterlife, ruled over by kindly spirits, and would
   laugh out loud in contempt at the concept of a stern and conquering
   Judge, weighing the lives of men in the balance. They do, however,
   believe that we can gain a kind of immortality, not by some impossible
   resurrection, but by doing great and astounding deeds, by inspired
   leadership, by securing a great insight into the nature of things that
   will leave the universe a better place than before.
   
   Both religions are often in contention with each other ("Supersitious
   fables!" vs. "Connect, man! Connect!").
   
   Both gag at the sight of other religions, esp. Christians ("I can't
   believe that ignorant people like you exist in this day and age!",
   "Onward walk the spiritually blind, refusing in their narrowmindedness
   to open their Third Eye, and see the significance of the Lines!")


"We Ourselves"

   The Antrans area highly extroverted, social, and fanciful people. Of
   the "Imperial" race (standard Solomani/Vilani parentage), they are
   only ho-hum physically, without the supernatural elegance and perfect
   physique that bioengineering grants most citizens of high-tech worlds.
   
   They take no particular pride in their status as subsector capital,
   but do take pride in their artistic endeavors. Their buildings, while
   not particularly 'artistic', do radiate a certain grace, a certain
   lightness. Their most famed artists are sometimes quiet, sometimes
   loud, but approach their work with a disciplined hand. Even third-rate
   artists from Antra are highly valued elsewhere: their command of the
   repertoire of Imperial culture is unmatched elsewhere, their intense
   understanding and respect of their audience (even as they recoil at
   their alieness) is known to all.
   
   There are several rituals and notable variations on Antra that should
   be noted by the casual traveller.
     * Greeting: when two friends meet, they give the standard greeting
       "Howdo?", then they both circle a point halfway between them in
       silence.After two revolutions, they clap hands and hug
       affectionately.
     * Children: Antrans love their children immensely, and enjoy showing
       them the world they live in. They happily haul their children to
       work, to play, to shop, to visit lovers, even to see (and laugh
       at) visitors.
       What they won't allow is for some filthy stranger to touch their
       children. Expect serious verbal abuse if you dare do so.
     * Life: Antra has no native lifeforms, and the locals have chosen to
       introduce nothing but plants and insects: but (after a checkup)
       the Antrans will allow animals on the world, as long as they are
       T-linked.
       (T-links come in two parts: one part goes on the owner's body, and
       the other around the animal's neck. If the animal leaves a certain
       distance from the owner, it suffers pain: if it crosses another
       threshhold, it dies.)
     * Clothing: Antrans have a sharp sense of what looks good: often
       their taste runs to simple and elegant, but many like large and
       loud. Either way, their clothing is comfortable, loose-fitting and
       of good quality. They don't go for effect-clothing, but there is a
       current fad for biolumenescent contact lenses (bright yellow, or
       Denebian red eyes, are the most desired.)
     * Food: While the Antrans have good taste everywhere else, they
       don't cut it when it comes to the belly. Then, they simply want it
       hot, spicy, and in He-man servings. Everything else is just a
       frill.
     * Literacy: Antrans, like most TL C+ societies, are functionally
       post-literate. However, old-fashioned bookreading is a growing fad
       among the elite, and the fad is starting to show up in popular
       culture.
   
   Regular life is much the same as on other high-tech worlds, with the
   cycle of conception (by whatever means), genetic therapy, birth,
   infant training, career selection, child-specific VR education, work,
   sex, ageing, and death. Marriages are rare (even for a high-tech
   world), but more people choose to raise children than on the typical
   High Stellar world.Antrans also place a higher value on "high-brow"
   culture and sophistication rather than focus on simple
   'stupid-foreigner' entertainment like some mindless talk show or
   sitcoms.
   
   The Immigrants, isolated in their shantytowns, live a different life.
   Imagine a vast, dirty-grey tent city, connected by a chain of fabric
   tunnels. Gangs of shadowy figures, huddled together, march from the
   asture factory towers to their ragged tents, to hide from the bitter
   -20 C cold. Inside, in a city without children, live the hard-bitten
   men who do the work meant for machines. Someone will die on the job
   tomorrow when their safety lines finally snap (Antrans don't waste
   grav belts on 'trash': men are far cheaper than grav belts to
   replace), or when their poorly maintained equipment is tested once too
   often.
   
   However, more deaths occur outside of the factories than inside. With
   only the most superficial medical care, a large portion of the workers
   are slowly dying (or going mad, or losing their vision) due to the
   noxious fumes of their work. (Remember, the robots that did the jobs
   before them didn't have to worry about breathing, or heat stroke, or
   the pounding noise destroying their eardrums). Moreover, the largely
   male workers get into endless fights, with handmade guns or knives.
   Women workers are sometimes left alone, but often are forced to take
   on a lover for protection, or simply for some companionship in their
   hard life.
   
   (Note: In many areas, the tent cities are pressurized, connected by a
   maze of fabric tunnels. Well, they are supposed to be pressurized: the
   poor-quality tents they were given are not built to take the damage
   the workers often inflict on them.)
