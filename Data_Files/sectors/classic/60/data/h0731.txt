Qevar

Qevar's atmosphere allows water to change from ice to vapor with only a brief liquid state. The atmosphere's vapor gives Qevar a brilliant luster when seen from space. Liquid water is prized; only the dictator and his nobles are allowed more than their needs. Noble status can be achieved with years of hard work and study -- some few commoners occasionally manage it. Nobles are required to treat commoners fairly, but death is a common legal penalty.
