Deneb

Imperial sector containing 385 systems lying beyond the Great Rift; named for the sector's brightest star, Deneb.

Deneb sector was fragmentarily settled by both Vilani and Vargr during the latter years of the First Imperium, but major developments of the sector only took place after Third Imperium Scout Service explorations located major resource worlds in quantity.

Industrial worlds that exploited those resources soon created trade routes and commercial ties that linked the Imperial core with the Spinward Marches.

Deneb sector is primarily Imperial. The Imperial border runs just within the coreward edge of the sector, and scattered Vargr systems (as well as non-aligned systems and client states) lie beyond the border.

The Imperial frontier begins at Deneb. Neither the First Imperium or the Second looked far beyond Corridor. The explorers of the Third Imperium boldly pressed onward, however, undeterred by the hazards lying in wait across the border.

People came to the frontier for many reasons. Some were drawn by real or believed opportunities. Others came to escape conditions at home: poverty, oppression, or overcrowding. Many citizens of Solomani descent were motivated solely by a desire for adventure.

Whatever their reasons, Imperial settlers rushed through Corridor in the early centuries of the Third Imperium's rule. Hostile Vargr and natural obstacles hindered their progress into Deneb. Nevertheless, the settlers slowly displaced the vargr, and Deneb finally saw true, planned development.

While exploratory efforts continued to move outward to the Spinward Marches, Trojan Reach, and sectors beyond, Deneb retained its frontier atmosphere. By this time, certain traits had already become deeply rooted in the settlers' character. Individualism, resourcefulness, and a strong belief in equality epitomized the Denebian mindset.
