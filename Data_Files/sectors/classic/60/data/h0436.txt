Endup

Heavily exploited for heavy metals for centuries, using convicted Imperial criminals as forced labor. A religious dictatorship now rules Endup. The "Ward of Vision" is seldom seen by the populace and is believed by them to be an all-seeing, all-knowing god. Local technology is limited to tech level 3 and the Ward uses his own superior technology to cow the populace. The lower elevations are polluted with unhealthful gases; the average lifespan is only 45 years. The higher elevations have pure air but are forbidden to the people on pain of death. The Ward encourages visits by offworlders, whom he hails to the populace as visiting gods from the heavens.
