Untouchable

This system should be considered to be an Ancient artifact in its entirety. Other than the mainworld belt and the one gas giant, the only other body in the system is an artificial satellite of size 5 in orbit around the gas giant. 
Attempts to come within 15AU of the primary of the system results in the destruction of the vessel in question, through an agency that is unknown. The best defenses available to investigating ships have been insufficient to protect them.
