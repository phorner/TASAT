Plafrezhdish (0138), like Bliazheprvlaf (0435), is a system with a 
 large star (type F size II) that is visible from Zhdant and was named 
 by them in pre-space flight times. 

 It has been announced that the base will be closing soon as the 
 changes in territory since the S'raak War make two bases in this 
 subsector too expensive to maintain. The Zhodani wish to sell the base 
 habitat itself, to not only avoid the expense of dismantling or 
 abandoning it but to make some money out of it as well. It is unknown 
 as to whether any colony groups have shown interest.
