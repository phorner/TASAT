Sitiefladr (0638) is a long settled, human populated world of Zhodani 
 stock. Average surface temperature is 21 degrees C, slightly warmer 
 than that of Terra, while rotational period is 32 hours. 

 High tech is available to those with power but most live in abject 
 poverty and struggle just to survive. The military is a popular choice 
 of career because you get good food on a regular basis. 

 Sitiefladr is ruled by whoever is in charge of the most powerful 
 corporation at any given time. The current Chairman is Zdiai 
 Tlotishdlezde, a woman whose unpopularity is matched only by her 
 power. Her corporation is called Kashyaljofla Qreql. Like many of her 
 predecessors, she has expansionist ideas (as the citizens of Jdakrief, 
 for instance, will attest). 

 Visiting merchants are treated well, as long as they restrict their 
 activities to trading and stay in safe districts. Sitiefladr has its 
 own merchants and starships, which can be found operating within a 20 
 parsec radius.
