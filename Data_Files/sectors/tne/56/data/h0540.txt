Dliatlirets (0540) is the home of a bipedal humanoid alien race, 
 called the Dliatlirets in Zdetl. They average 2.4m in height but more 
 muscular. They have greenish skin (usually adorned with red and purple 
 pigments). They have no nose and so, as the saying goes, cannot smell. 
 Their heads tend to be circular and their arms protrude from about 
 half way up their torsos. 

 They respect physical prowess of all sorts, but particularly in 
 military skills. They are sometimes employed offworld for bodyguard 
 duties. They disdain higher technology, believing that it weakens 
 moral fibre. The system is named for the Zhodani name for the race. 

 The world has a rotational period of only 10 hours, one of the fastest 
 in the sector. Day and night mean much less to the Dliatlirets race 
 than most races.
