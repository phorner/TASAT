Odreitsvoz (2934): Odreitsvoz was originally colonised as part of the 
 Driantia Steblenzhtia, but later seceded after a coup by a group of 
 young nobles. The coup was ill-fated, since problems caused by their 
 harsh rule and the arguments between the noble families split the 
 planet into 30 nations within three generations. Nearby worlds were 
 able to play the various nations against each other to gain great 
 market penetration.
