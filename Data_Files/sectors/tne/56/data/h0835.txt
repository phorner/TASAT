Zdoblze (0835) is often visited by merchant craft, trading between the 
 Talpaku and the jump-2 worlds to rimward. Pirates have used the system 
 to prey on such ships from time to time in the past, but the last such 
 activity was many decades ago. The system was once an amber zone, but 
 this was rescinded when the piracy ceased.
