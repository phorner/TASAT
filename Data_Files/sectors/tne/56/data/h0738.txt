Friaprchivzhdo (0738) The world was originally settled in 633 by the 
 Driantia Sitiefladr (q.v.). This system was to be the breadbasket of 
 the state. The economy was once much stronger and the world had a C 
 class starport, but harder times struck and the economy disintegrated 
 around 861. Lawlessness prevailed and the system was rated an amber 
 zone. 

 Most of the population roams the world in vehicles maintained with 
 cannibalised parts. The nomads live a tribal existence, where only the 
 fittest survive. Some possess certain technical skills that have been 
 passed down through the generations. 

 Some others have fallen right back to primitive lifestyles, living in 
 coastal and river villages as various types of hunter/gatherers. These 
 are raided for food from time to time by nearby communities are 
 various types. 

 The cities are mostly ruined and decayed, though there are still 
 enclaves with power and the ability to maintain most of their 
 equipment. These are in communication with each other by radio, but 
 there is no world government. Enclave dwellers sometimes communicate 
 and trade with passing starships. 

 The chirpers have been living in the forests of the world all along, 
 though they were beaten back back somewhat as wilderness areas were 
 cleared for farmlands by the original colony. Many of these areas have 
 regrown and the chirpers have returned, where they compete quite 
 successfully with the human hunter/gatherers.
