Quicksilver (0233) A charismatic dark eccentric Talpak named 
 Yichewhuya Quicksilver led a rebel group here. They considered 
 themselves to be totally separate from the Communality, which they 
 expected to take over at some point in the future. They even claimed 
 Tavrniapichia (0134) and Zdemedre (0332) for future expansion. When 
 commercial exploitation of Zdemedre began in about 1180, their 
 possession instinct was triggered and they demanded withdrawal of 
 operations. The demands were ignored (since they often made grandiose 
 statements, no one realised that these were genuine) and so they 
 attacked the largely defenceless world, killing many and expelling the 
 rest. 

 Zdemedre obtained Communality naval assistance and rolled back the 
 Quicksilver assault. Even after this defeat, the Quicksilverites 
 continued to act, using terrorism (letter bombs and the like) against 
 the company. The Communality demanded that the leaders of Quicksilver 
 surrender and that the world accept an occupation force, but these 
 demands were refused and the populace as a whole began to stockpile 
 caches of weapons and bombs. In the end, the arriving occupation force 
 was attacked by nuclear missiles in orbit and the commander reacxted 
 in kind. 

 A nuclear attack began, the effect of which was worsened by the 
 (unknown) fact that some of the orbital facilities were plutonium 
 enrichment plants. When they were destroyed, the wreckage fell out of 
 orbit, distributing more radioactive particles. 

 The world was declared a radiation hazard and a radio beacon was 
 established to warn passing shipping.
