Chtashekldlanz (0534) is a high density world (surface gravity 1.0 
 standard), used by Talpaku and Fliblshichtia (0434) companies, none of 
 which claim the system. So the world is effectively balkanised, each 
 "government" being a different company. 

 Large areas are dried up oceans, so there are huge salt flats, with 
 some intermittent rivers and salt lakes in the deeper portions. The 
 companies harvest minerals from these salt flats. The sights are quite 
 unusual; in one area, a deep trench between tectonic plates holds 
 water but the bordering hills and flats are quite dry. Day and night 
 temperatures can be at opposite extremes, due to the 42 hour 
 rortational period. 

 Most companies involved are operating at tech 9. In the case of 
 Fliblshichtia, this is because that is their prevailing tech level. In 
 the case of the Talpaku, this is because they are companies who have 
 learnt from Zdemedre (0332) and have bought up cheap, surplus 
 equipment to survive. The Talpaku companies are working with mixed 
 tech 9 and A.
