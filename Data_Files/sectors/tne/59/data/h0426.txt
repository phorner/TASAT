Ilium     

Ilium, ecxept for its sulfuric taint, seems like a perfect Darrian world with its warm, thin atmosphere and productive agriculture.  This is because the pre-Maghiz Darrians terraformed its atmosphere by seeding bacteria and plants for decades before human colonies settled permanently.  The sulfur was a byproduct of their efforts to make the planetary crust out-gas more efficiently.

Ilium survived the isolated centuries fairly well, but remained at a very low tech level.  Its inhabitants had gradually developed to about tech level 8 when they were recontacted from Mire.  Today Ilium is a major naval base.
