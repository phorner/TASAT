Mire

Capital of Darrian Confederation.  One of the Confederation worlds, Mire has become an underground world, which allows the surface to be used for agriculture and natural preserves.  Government is a major industry on Mire.  Bureaucrats and military personnel are to be found virtually everywhere.  Most of the large corporations keep offices here.
