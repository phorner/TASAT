Choleosti

	An undeveloped and ignored system on the Imperial fringe. The largest satellite of a ringed gas giant called Cholprime, Cholesti is lifeless, barren, egg-shaped and tide-locked by the attraction of the gas giant.
	Once, when further development of local trade routes was planned, a class C starport was begun on Choleosti.  The alienation of the Sword Worlds caused the project to be dropped, and the nearly completed port was abandoned.  The Zhodani occupied it as a base of operation during the 5FW.
	Choleosti is continually torn by seismic disturbances, due to its close orbit.  Quakes and rockslides are common.
