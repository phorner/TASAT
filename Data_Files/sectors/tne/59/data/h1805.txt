Uakye 

This is tidally locked world.  Fortunately, most of the land surface is along the twilight zone.

The largest island, Triante, has forest, beach, and swamp terrain.  Uakye City lies on the northern shore (toward the dark side.) Directly north of Uakye City is the Shallows, a large expanse of ocean barely more than a meter deep.  An abandoned military base sits on the eastern edge of the island.

The island of Linradis, small and isolated, lies several hundred kilometers north of Uakye, deep in the world's dark side.  Roughly halfway between is Staging Point, a remote island poutpost for treavellers between the two places.  Even farther north, in the center of the dark hemisphere, is Mining Colony 78, situated under a large icecap.
