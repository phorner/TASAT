Dinom 

	The star is a very large, very bright giant visible throughout the subsector, and would not normally have planets.  Dinom is a rogue: originally a gas giant moon, it is now caught in the gas giant's trojan point. The northern hemisphere points toward the star (and will for another 200 years.)  Gravity is about 0.2G.  Rhylan starport, a large open area with a clearly marked boundary, is adjacent to Rhylan city. The world's population of 230,00 is concentrated in three cities (names: Rhylan, Medianne, and Napan) which house ore-processing centers. A monorail circles this vacuum world, bringing ores to the starport. In 1106, a revolution shut down the world's economy.
