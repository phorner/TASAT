Torment

Torment is a prison planet for the most incorrigible of criminals, those whom Darrian psychologists have judged impossible to cure of violent tendencies.  It is miserably cold and barren, consisting only of the one central village of convicts.  They are required to work in mining and industry to pay for the import of enough food to support them.  The prison is run by a hierarchy of criminals who demand obediance from their fellow convicts.  This obediance has little to do with law and order, as might be expected.  They select their own successors before dying.
