VICTORIA

IISS rediscovered Victoria in 901.  After a short period of clandestine observation and contact, the world was interdicted.  The stated purpose was to shield the developing culture as it coped with its lack of metal resources.  A very old world, Victoria orbits a population II star, and is deficient in metals and heavy elements.

Its cratering resulted from an intense planetary bombardment in which asteroids were evidently used as missiles.  The extensive bombardment beat the planet almost to complete destruction.  Calculations indicate that one more asteroid hit at that time could have cracked the crust and fragmented the world into a new asteroid belt.  Erosion dating indicated the attack occurred about 300,000 PI (Pre-Imperium), a date which matches with the established period of the Final War of the Ancients.  (A copy of initial contact and exploration report by the Scout Service should be on file in the ship's library.)

The hydrographic coverage is mostly shallow seas.  Humans must wear oxygen masks or remain above 1000 meters elevation.  Nearly all of the human population, estimated at 10 million, live on the Mesas (outcroppings created by the bombardment.)  Commerce between the Mesas relies on dirigibles.
