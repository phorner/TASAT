Aramanx      

A balkanized world at the edge of the Towers Cluster. Its population is currently 1.6 billion.

Eight major and at least twenty minor countries divide the world.  Sporadic conflicts are almost constant.  While raids and border clashes occur, no nation seems willing to go over the edge into all-out war - yet. The "Powderkeg of the Towers Cluster" enjoys comparative peace, but it could easily descend into a shattering world war. 
	Sternmetal supports the nation of Lovrenyi (pop 37 million.) Several nations have been forced into its sphere of influence, but an ongoing guerilla war continues in one conquest. The Republic of Lanax, on this frontline, has hired Vargr mercenaries.
