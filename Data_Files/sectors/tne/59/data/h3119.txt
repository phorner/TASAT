Vanejen 

A rich world with a dense, breathable atmosphere. Icecaps cover 20% of the world's surface. Population is currently 543 million, distributed over three of the four continents, with scattered settlement on the barren fourth continent.  This was a lost colony.  During the Fourth Frontier War, the Navy needed a base. The locals were recontacted, and catapulted into the reaches of interstellar society in just a few years.
