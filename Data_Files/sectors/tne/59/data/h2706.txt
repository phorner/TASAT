Heguz 

	A dangerous, mysterious world. Two colonies failed for unexplained reasons.  The first had 20,000 citizens in 649, but a supply ship found no trace of it in 650. The colony was reestablished in a few years, but it (and 70,000 inhabitants) disappeared again in the early 900s.  Both were formed around large, floating bases of the type often established on water worlds.  Searches of large areas of the ocean floor found no trace of either.
