Ruie 

Balkanized, industrialized, and very autonomous world on the frontiers of the Imperium.  A former Lost Colony, it had worked its way up to tech level 5 by the time the Scout Service rediscovered it in 1074.  Of its four major powers, Jingarlu and the Comors Union are now at tech level 7, and open for trade with off-worlders (subject to local laws and customs.)  Certain other areas, however, are hostile.

Ruie was surveyed and settled at about the same time as Regina, but its culture was structured as isolationist; presented with an opportunity to join the Imperium in 235, it declined, and has remained an independent world since.
