	Widespread taint in the form of heavy metal dust and oxides makes the atmosphere, otherwise quite ordinary, unbreathable without a filter mask.  The dust triggers allergies with great frequency, causes a wide variety of respiratory illnesses, and can cause carcinoma within years of exposure.  Great pains are necessary to keep food clean and uncontaminated; filter masks can be removed only for very short periods, such as when eating and drinking.  A covert Zhodani operation established the class A starport through an Imperial corporation before the last war. The scheme was discovered just in time: the Zhodani almost had a base waiting for besieging Rhylanor.
