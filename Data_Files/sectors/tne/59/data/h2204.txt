Beck's World   
	Colonized in 228 as Frisini, Beck's World was a crucial battlefield in the Civil War, finally falling to a pro-Imperial mercenary regiment. Beck's Bruins, under Colonel Vilna Beck, stayed after the war, rewarded with land grants on their conquest.  The planet's name was changed to Beck's World.  The medium-size Ancient site is a collapsed warren of interlocking caverns only partially excavated.
