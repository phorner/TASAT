Tarkine
An agricultural producer of exotic spices. 

In 960 it was discovered that corsairs operating in the surrounding systems were supplied personnel, technical assistance, and fuel by Tarkine's government in exchange for a share of captured goods.  An Imperial task force was dispatched, the corsairs destroyed, the government replaced, and a scout base established.  Continued uprisings among the world's six million inhabitants have led the world to be posted as an amber travel zone.

The starport, located by a major river, consists of the scout base, a large administrative building, fuel processing facilities and storage tanks (underground), and numerous smaller buildings containing mainten-ance, technical, communications, and entertainment facilities.  There is little provision for mercantile ship-ping (only four pads and a couple of warehouses and admin shacks), and they are not often used.  The overall impression is of an armed camp, and not a free starport.  Starport security is tight, and off-port leaves are not encouraged.  A city with 22,000 inhabitants is 25 km away along the same river.
