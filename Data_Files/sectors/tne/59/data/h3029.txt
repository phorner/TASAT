Palique

This industrial world is well-known for its vacuum suits (tech level E) and its air cycling equipment.  Palique's orbit is inclined to the system's plane of the ecliptic, and it passes through an asteroid belt at the same distance from the star twice per local year.  The hazard from meteorite showers has led to almost total underground construction.
