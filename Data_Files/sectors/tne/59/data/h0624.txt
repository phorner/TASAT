Jacent       

Even though its atmosphere is very thin, Jacent is a habitable planet due to a high oxygen percentage in its air, primarily the result of extremely active marine plant life and Jacent's close orbit.  The sea supports a broad native ecology which the humans make some use of, but only plants inhabit the land, and these are being displaced by imported species of more use to people.
The planetary congress consists of representatives from 25 administrative districts of the planet.
