Rorre

A member of the Confederation, Rorre was colonized by Darrians who wanted to keep their pre-contact tech level while the rest of Darrian surged ahead.  Ironically, it was the one colony that survived well when the first confederation fell apart in the maghiz.  Such technology as there is belongs to a small class who run the production of the planet.  The most important industry of Rorre is tourism. Its long seasons allow extended vacations or sabbaticals for scholars and businessmen alike.
