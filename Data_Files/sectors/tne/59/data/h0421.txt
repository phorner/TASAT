Zamine 

Settled by the second Darrian Confederation (After -275.)

Zamine is one of four balkanized worlds in the Darrian Confederation.  Through most of its history, this simply meant that the people disagreed about government.  Disputes were typically settled in summit meetings and world courts rather than through open warfare.  However, in the last twenty years, Zamine has seen some very unDarrianlike violence.  There have been increasing small wars, hostage takings, and violent demonstrations.  Currently there is a civil war in Baruk, and several factions in Mabek Ladh are hostile to the Confederation.  Starships are advised to approach landing sites in these nations with caution.

Much trade on Zamine is conducted by sea.  At tech level 10, very little use is made of gravitics due to their high expense.  The main products are agricultural products, ores and petroleum, weapons, and mechanical parts.

On Zamine, a day lasts nearly all year long.  That is, the rotation period is 3.6 days and the orbital period is 4 days.  The dense atmosphere tends to moderate the effects of these long days and nights, but the temperature is hot enough to please any native Darrian.
