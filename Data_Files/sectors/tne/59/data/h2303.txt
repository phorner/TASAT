Yorbund

The local atmosphere is insidious, and corrosive. Tunnels and portals provide safe access to all facilities at Marion Starport. Nearby are the minor attractions of the Caverns of Yorbund.

The planet is largely unexplored, as few individuals venture far from the starport and its associated caverns.  Cloaked in a dense overcast atmosphere, the surface  features are largely unknown.  Yorbund is subject to seismic tremors and considerable volcanism.
