Nexine

An underpopulated world where the Ministry of Conservation currently operates a reseeding program using biologically altered humans.  Candidates are provided with gill implants, synthetic skin insulation, and webbed extremities; they are transplanted to Nexine and participate in sea farming operations under the world's shallow oceans.
