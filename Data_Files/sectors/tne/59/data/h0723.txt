Trifuge

Settled by the second Darrian Confederation (After -275.)


A member of the Darrian Group, Trifuge has the longest year of all the Darrian planets.  Its giant primary keeps it warm even at 122 AU from the star.  It was first colonized as a company planet with heads of corpor-ations prooviding houses and services for their employees.  It is still run by industrial executives and their scientific advisors.  Some relatively advanced native species are studied on Trifuge.
