Terant 340

Settled by the second Darrian Confederation (After -275.)

A desert world, Terant 340 was colonized under domes using strict water recycling.  Terant's primaries have many interesting anomalies which intrigued the Darrian astrophysicists.  The planetoid belts harbor enough resources to make self-sufficiency possible.  Terant 340 is the largest chunk of circling debris prevented from coalescing into a planet by the disturbing influence of the white dwarf companion and three gas giants.  The system has no other worlds between gas giants and planetoid size.
