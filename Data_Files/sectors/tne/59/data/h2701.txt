Lablon 

An agricultural world whose economy is supported mostly by selling agricultural products to the Vargr through the trading station.  The population of 500,000 live in small farming towns scattered about the most fertile areas of the four continents.  The government, the Lablon Planetary Cartel, is mainly responsible for insuring that no community exports for other than the legally set price: since the prices are high, there is little resistance.
