Kedin

A lawless frontier world before the collapse, Kedin's population has shrunk and its people live a low-tech existence. Most of the inhabitants are subsistance farmers, clustered in small settlements near the old starport. The settlements are democraticly governed, and each sends a representative to a council which resolves intersettlement disputes. In practice, this council is a powerless forum for debate, rather than a true "planetary government".
