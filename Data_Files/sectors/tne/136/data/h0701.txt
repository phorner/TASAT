Kazan

Previously a refuelling stop for traders along the Antraillian Main, Kazan lost over 95% of its population in a Vampire raid which literally bombed it back into the stone age. Kazan quickly degenerated into chaos and lawlessness as the remaining people struggled desperately to survive. Eventually, the dictator Samark managed to restore order  and began the arduous task of rebuilding a technological society. However, upon his death rival lieutenants struggled for power, plunging Kazan back 
into chaos again and destroying all that Samark had struggled for. The planet was only reunited again in 1189, by one of the great dictator's many grandsons. Unfortunately, the new ruler is more in the mold of a classic TED than his illustrious forebear, using his superior TL-5 weaponry to maintain his power over the struggling peasants.
