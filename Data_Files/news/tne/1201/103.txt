COALINFONET, CLASS: NEWSREPORT, DISTRIBUTION: PUSH, AUTHORITY CIN/AUBAINE RC ASSEMBLY HALL, AUBAINE (0738/AUBAINE, A78A884-C), 103-1201
Ililek Kuligaan, renowned remnant, was called before the Assembly today to explain his refusal to have an RCES clipper named for him. His remarks, for which the press was allowed access to the hall, were characteristically blunt.
'You can't name a ship after a living person, especially not me. You can say what you like about me after I'm dead, because I won't be around to make you a liar. But why make some poor kids wear my name on their sleever when I might still do something to make them ashamed? You're better off naming it aftersomeonewho is safely dead. Dead, packaged, and marketed, of course.

"However, since you were so kind to name it after me, I claim the right to name it myself, and hereby change the name to Immanuel Kant That way you can keep the initials, and you don't have to worry about him embarrassing you. He was a finer man than me, and also unlike me, Kant was so reliable that people used to set their watches by him. Having his name around will remind people to think about some important things.

"What things? Fortunately I have with me a quote from the good Herr Doktor. "It says, 'Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or that of any other, never simply as a means, but also at the same time as an end.' What that means, for those of you who don't speak deathless prose, is: Give a damn about the people around you. We Imperials forgot that lesson once, and we continue on at our peril if we ever forget it again.

"Thank you. I hope you people haven't blocked me in again."

The clipper, the sixth of the class built, will be delivered from Standard Astrotronics' Aubaine yards this month. was named for Professor Kuligaan by a special motion in the Assembly earlier this year.
