RCES Headquarters announced today that a full inquiry would be convened to establish the particulars of the controversial Operation Cosmic Fire, conducted on the planet Daaliisa three months ago. It has been claimed that the operation was an unjustifiable use of Coalition military force, and by attacking the neutral native Droyne population, unnecessarily poisoned relations with the inhabitants of the world for the forseeable future.

Witnesses are scheduled to include Commodore Sean Lathrop, RCES Chief of Operations, members of the RCES Long Range Planning Croup, Captain Cynta Lawter and other crewmembers of RCS Aube, and Gabrielle Diabla, the reporter who first brought the event to public attention.
