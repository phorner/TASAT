RCES MIL TRAFFIC, CLASS: NOTICE TO STARFARERS, DISTRIBUTION: MANDTY, AUTHORITY COMMANDER, RCES DAWN BASE (TRYBEC/0336/AUBAI NE, B443610-A), 326-1201 KEYWORDS: VIRUS, HAZARD TO TRAVEL, VAMPIRE 
RC space forces have issued a Notice to Starfarers for the Arvid (0131/Aubaine) and Mitchell (3034/Khulam/Diaspora) star systems. These systems appear to present an active Viral or vampire threat, and are to be avoided until more information becomes available. 

Arvid is thought to be connected to the disappearance of several vessels, including Dawn League Ships Reine Soleil and Elise, although it is not known by what mechanism these disappearances were caused, or even if they were the result of a single cause. 

Mitchell is believed to bethe base of an active and growing vampire fleet, and is probably connected to the loss of Dawn League Ship Hellos, missing since 19/X1/1199. 

RC space forces will attempt to evaluate and neutralize these threats. Private exploration is not advised. Exercise extreme caution when entering or passing nearthese systems, and if possible, avoid passing through them at all. Even gas giant refueling is considered to be hazardous in these systems.
