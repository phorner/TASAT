The Reformation Coalition Exploratory Service, in conjunction with the Standard Astrotronics Orbital Shipyard, Aubaine, announces the sealing of RS Maggart, the first unit of the Croup IV Aurora-class clippers. RS Maggart was sealed on 25M11/1201 at the orbital building ways of Standard AstrotronicsAubaine yard.

The ceremonial act of sealing a starship is the orbital construction equivalent of launching an ocean-going vessel or a spacecraft constructed on a planetary surface. Itis traditionally considered tobe one of the most significant milestones in the career of a spacecraft, as it is now capable of preserving life. It is at the sealing that spacecraft are traditionally christened with their /lames, following the obligatory pressure test. Once a ship is sealed, its interior spaces are no longer in vacuum, but are maintained by artificial life support, which allows the vessel's construction to proceed to completion in a "shirt sleeves" environment.

RS Maggart is the first of a class of greatly modified Aurora-class clippers, called Group IV. The Group IV is also called the "Stretch" Aurora because of its greater overall length, allowing the clipping of more multimission modules to the ship's open spine. This greater carriage capacity also requires the Group IVs to have a new engineering section to allow maneuver and jump at the same performance as the earlier members of the class. RS Maggart is named for Burton L. Maggart (1110-1 1 95), First Minister of Aubaine and one of the founders of the intentellar accords that led to the League of the New Dawn, and ultimately, to the Reformation Coalition. Burt Maggart was also the father of the current Coalition Secretary Ceneral, Lon E. Maggart.

RS Maggart was christened by Enlilli Maggart, wife of First Minister Maggart and mother of the Secretary General.
