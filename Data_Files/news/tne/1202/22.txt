After a protracted and costly battle in far planetary orbit, a large vampire ship was damaged and today withdrew from the Nike Nimbus system. The vampire vessel was believed to be a former Imperial destroyer of the Midu Agashaan class. Some surface bombardment of Nike Nimbus was carried out before the attack was broken off.
 Coalition casualties were heavy in the operation. A combined squadron of the RC Navy and Nimban Navy vessels engaged the vampire ship, and a number of vessels were badly damaged. RCS Eos is known to have been lost with all hands. Other ship losses, if any, are unknown at this time. RCS Eos, an Aurora-class clipper, is the first Coalition major naval combatant to be lost in combat.
 The death toll on the ground has already topped 30,000, and many others are still missing and feared dead, making this the worst disaster in the short history of the Coalition and Dawn League.
 Sources close to the regional naval staff report that the need to shift fleet assets coreward and trailing in response to the growing threat from the Soleean Empire has left the spinward frontier under-protected. The losses suffered here today can only mean that fleet assets will be stretched that much thinner.
