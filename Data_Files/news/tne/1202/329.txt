RCN forces are operating at a high level of readiness following the announcement earlier this afternoon of the loss of RCS Marathon Victrix in the Shenk subsector. All leaves have been cancelled for RCN ships in the Aurora system, and it is expected that all naval vessels present will put to space while they are fully crewed.

Expected to depart are the sloops Coral Sea Victrix, Riggins Victrix, Kelley Victrix, and the clippers Aurora and Apollo. Their destination is presumed to be the Shenk Rimward Main, via Eos, Ra and Fisher's World.
