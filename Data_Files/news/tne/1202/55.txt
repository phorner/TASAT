RC space forces have issued a Notice to Starfarers for the entire Khulam Main, including all worlds connected by jump-1 routes from Montezuma (2836/Khulam/Diaspora) to Khesanadu (2731/Khulam/Diaspora) star systems. These systems appear to present an active Viral or vampire threat, and are to be avoided until more information becomes available. Recent reports indicate that at least two free traders have been lost in the Khulam Main to vampire activity in the last three months, and one RCES multi-mission scout was recently posted as past due and is now presumed to be lost.
 RC space forces will attempt to evaluate and neutralize these threats. Private exploration is not advised.
 Exercise extreme caution when entering or passing near these systems, and if possible, avoid passing through them at all. Even gas giant refueling is considered to be hazardous in these systems.
