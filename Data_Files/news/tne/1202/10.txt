An official spokesman from the Public Affairs Office of the RC Navy issued a press statement today announcing the establishment of four deep-space refueling stations within the RC borders. This doesn't come as much of a surprise, as the existence of these four d/s stations has been one of the worst-kept secrets in the history of the RC. The four stations are located at 0833/Aubaine, 0938/Oriflamme, 1034/Oriflamme, and 1137/Oriflamme. These stations are being supported by two squadrons of Oasis-class tankers (modified relic Xboat tenders). Sahara squadron is based out of Baldur and services the stations at 0833 and 1034. Gobi squadron is based out of Shenandoah and services the stations at 0938 and 1137. 

These stations are open to the general starfaring public (in fact, these stations were supposedly established "to promote interstellar commerce within the RC"), but be advised that the stations themselves and the surrounding "airspace" within a radius of 300,000 kilometers are under martial law due to the hazardous environment. Be sure to follow *all* established protocols for these situations. 

Also included in this press release was an announcement that the RCN is accepting bids from civilian enterprises to assume responsibility for maintaining these stations.
