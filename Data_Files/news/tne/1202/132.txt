The normally unflappable citizenry of Brusman were electrified by the twin announcement of the recovery of the survivors of the Dawn League ship Lady Elise and the opening of relations with the .Covenant of Sufren, a previously unknown starfaring civilization

The announcement followed the successful return of a rescue mission dispatched to the planet Promise in the Promise subsector. Although returning personnel ware sequestered for debriefing, unofficial reports described a nightmare world inhabited by Virus-infected advanced technology robots.

The Covenant of Sufren is apparently a small group of inhabited worlds to coreward of the Coalition, but with a governmental structure and social outlook similar to our own. Senior assembly representatives have expressed cautious optimism concerning the possibility of cooperation between the two governments.

DLS Lady Elise was one of the first Dawn League warships outfitted to discover the fate of the original 12 diplomatic vessels. The vessel disappeared without a trace in 1200, and was long since thought to have been a victim of Vampire activity. Initial reports seem to confirm that theory.
