Today saw the long-awaited opening of the exhibition "Why Cats Paint: A theory of feline aesthetics" in the newly renovated Bridget Wing of the Brusman Cultural Center.

"Why Cats Paint' is a lavish celebration of the largely unappreciated aesthetic sensibilities of cats, and is described by its organizers as also functioning as an experiment in inter-species morphic resonance and formative causation.

In addition to paintings by acknowledged masters Tiger, Bootsie, Misty, Lu Lu and Wong Wong, the exhibition features works of sculpture and cat performance art, the first of its kind to see public exhibition. The centerpiece of the show is the magnificent Breakfast, commissioned specifically for this show from Tiger, leader of the spontaneous reductionist school.

Show organizers Heather Bush and Burton Sliver were on hand for the gala reception, along with two of the featured artists, duo painters Lu Lu and Wong Wong.

'Why Cats Paint: A theory of feline aesthetics" will remain open in the Brusman Cultural Center's Bridget Wing through the end of Capricorn.
