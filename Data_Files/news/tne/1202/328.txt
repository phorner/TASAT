The Commander, Reformation Coalition Navy regrets to announce that the Reformation Coalition Ship Marathon Victrix (TAILNO 10050) is missing and presumed lost in routine operations in the Shenk subsector. Marathon Victrix is a sloop of the Victrix class, displacing 400 tons and carrying a crew of 26. She was completed at Trybec and was employed primarily in frontier patrol duties.

The navy is unable to confirm or deny whether the loss has any connection with the speculated existence of a foreign starfaring power operating in the Shenk subsector, but is undertaking an inquiry to establish the cause of the ship's disappearance. RCN and RCES vessels operating in the subsector have been ordered to operate at a higher level of vigilance for the duration of this inquiry.
