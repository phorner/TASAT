Unofficial RCN sources confirm rumors that there is a starfaring organization operating somewhere in the Shenk subsector, immediately to coreward of the Oriflamme subsector. Indications are that this organization is a human government rather than a vampire fleet, although such assessmentsare only tentative.

Details of the size or extent of operations of this group are not available, but it is known that they operate in the Shenk Rimward Main, and have been observed to operate starships in the 30,000 displacement ton range, significantly larger than any starships apemted by the Reformabon Coalition. The operations that have been observed are not consistent with either Free Trader or Mercantile Guild activities as these new activities are much more extensive.

It is not known at this time whether or not this organization presents a threat to the Coalition, although the characteristics of their shipping indicate that the potential is there.
