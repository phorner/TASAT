Celetron/Core

Celetron, the site of Imperial Research Station Omicron, was savagely attacked today by a large fleet under the command of the assassin Dulinor, in one last mad attempt to destroy the rightful Imperial government.

Dulinor, known to have gon mad now that he possesses what he believes to be unstoppable superweapons produced by his Droyne slaves, dishonorably defeated the valiant Imperial forces defending this strategic system.

A major target of this attack was the Imperial scientific outpost Omicron, where Dulinor's forces landed commando troops who ransacked the station's databanks, looking for more information to fuel Dulinor's twisted ambitions.  This attempted failed, as the commandos were unable to return to their landers to make their escape, but were instead defeated by the resourceful scientists on the base who fought to defend their research from corrupt use.

This battle further sapped the strength of the invader, who will find he is still as far from Capital as if he had remained with his daughter at his home on Dian.  A man who wages war by treachery and deceit, by assassination and secret ancient weapons can never win the final victory.

The Celtron system defense squadron is regrouping, and will not be found by Dulinor to be a welcome opponent the next time.
