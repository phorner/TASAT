Lanth/Lanth (0109-A879533-B) Date: 096-1109 
Only days after the Imperial 193rd fleet left Lanth for a reported assembly of Sword World forces at Tavonni the Sword Worlders appeared in the Lanth system and immediately began landing forces. Local resistance was fierce, but futile. 

The return of the Imperial fleet after failing to find the enemy in Tavinni, however, caught the Sworld Worlders by surprise, and resulted in severe losses to the enemy. Imperial forces continue to mop up in the Lanth system. [JTAS #16]
