Rhylanor/Rhylanor (0306-A434934-F) Date: 348-1109 
A major Zhodani task force was badly mauled in the attempt to retake the Calit system (which was liberated by Imperial forces earlier this year.) Enemy forces were "dealt a serious blow" in the words of one officer. Imperial and Colonial forces in the Calit system were evidently heavily reinforced after the battle to retake the system. 

No information is available concerning the battle or any casualties among the forces involved. [JTAS #19]
