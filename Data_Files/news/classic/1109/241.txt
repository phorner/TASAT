Lanth/Lanth (0109-A879533-B) Date: 241-1109 
The commander of the Imperial 193 Fleet has officially declared the mopping up of Sword World forces in the Lanth system to be complete, after months of heavy fighting. 

"Reports of atrocities against the civilian populace are unfounded," the fleet public relations officer declared in a press release, "The enemy forces were too heavily involved in fighting us to be able to have committed any crimes against the locals." The officer went on to note that rumors of atrocities are common after any battle, because of the high degree of emotion generated. 

No information is available on casualties, either military or civilian, but a highly placed source indicated that 193 Fleet has requested large numbers of ground reinforcements, indicating heavy casualties, at least in its ground forces.
