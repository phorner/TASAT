In a recorded message to the press, the office of Admiral Lord Santanocheev announced that the Naval Base at Ghandi (Lanth 0205) is under attack by Zhodani naval and ground forces, including several units of the elite Zhodani Consular Guard. The statement indicated that the garrison at Ghandi had recently been reinforced because of the Zhodani presence at Calit (Vilis 0705). 

This announcement has fuelled speculation that a major Zhodani push is underway, with Rhylanor as its most likely target. If Ghandi falls, it will be a major blow to the Imperial war effort, possibly a fatal one. [JTAS #15]
