All Vargr forces allied with the Outworld Coalition have been instructed by their supreme commander to cease hostilities and surrender to the Imperial military or present themselves to a neutral power for internment. Unconfirmed rumor states the Vargr forces have withdrawn from the Coalition, and are now negotiating a separate peace agreement. 

Speculation is rampant in all governmental circles as to the ramifications of this action, both with regard to the war and with regard to post-war policies in the Vargr Extents. [JTAS #18]
