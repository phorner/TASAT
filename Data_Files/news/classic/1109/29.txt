Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 029-1109 
Operation Iedshrpr, several months in secret preparation, was launched by elements of the Imperial Navy's Corridor Fleet in a drive to break the siege of Efate and force back the Zhodani forces currently operating in Regina subsector. 

Commander Aia Resortin, fleet press officer, stated, "Admiral Santanocheev has planned a brilliant campaign for the relief of Efate. Denial of Efate to the Zhodani means denial of the whole subsector. This operation is the turning point of the war." 

Regrettably, the meeting was cut short by a Zhodani hit-and-run raid, which partially damaged some buildings, but had no other effect. [JTAS #16]
