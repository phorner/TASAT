DENTUS/REGINA (0601-C979500-A) DATE: 063-1112 
Informed sources today leaked information indicating that the group of renegade Vargr which have eluded capture since the end of the recent war has probably fled the Spinward Marches for parts unknown. Several alleged members of the group were reputed to have been captured when they attempted to hijack a merchant ship near here late last year, and have been held incommunicado since that time. 

Admiralty public relations officer Captain Gaviin Ammern refused to comment when asked why the capture of some of the renegades has been kept secret for so long. [Challenge/JTAS 25]
