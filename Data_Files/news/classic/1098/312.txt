Imperial Navy Lieutenant Commander Niit Brzk was today awarded the Medal for Conspicuous Gallantry for his actions in command of the frigate Unekhzektha in the Tekahiu system.  Lieutenant Commander Brzk was engaged in a routine beyond the border sweep into non-aligned territory when his ship came upon an Imperial merchant vessel under attack by three Vargr corsairs.  Lieutenant Commander Brzk, despite the raiders' superior numbers, engaged immediately and destroyed two and drove off the third while preventing serious damage to the Imperial merchant.
