SHARIM/GUSHEMEGE (1038 A435967-F) Date: 194-1120 
Doubt continues as to the truth behind the reappearance of Strephon in Gushemege sector, despite the virtually absolute evidence that he died in Dulinor's assassination plot on Capital in 1116. 

Recent conjectures in the press have provided three distinct explanations for the individual calling himself Strephon. He could be a surgically altered actor, a pseudobiological robot, a clone, or the real Strephon (whose double died in the assassination). 

No firm evidence has been presented for or against any of these conjectures. 

Surprisingly, several leading nobles (including Brzk and Margaret) have made public statements leaving open the possibility that the individual in Gushemege is really Strephon. On the other hand, the only thing that Lucan and Dulinor seems to agree on is that the "real" Strephon is an imposter. [Challenge 44]
