Julian Trane, distinguished professor of interstellar history, has committed suicide in prison, according to police. 

Guards delivering lunch found Trane hanging from a hand computer strap in his cell. 

Trane was arrested almost two months ago for ignoring an Imperial Ministry of Information ban against the publication of his new book, The Inevitability of Night. 

Imperial authorities expressed their regret at the death. 

"Professor Trane's suicide is another in the list of crimes for which the ultimate responsibility belongs to Archduke Dulinor," a spokesman said. [Challenge 46]
