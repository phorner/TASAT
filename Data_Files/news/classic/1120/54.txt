The pirate video source with broadcast stations in the Sylean worlds today added programming in support of Brzk of Antares as the only true contender for emperor of the Third Imperium. Until today, the video programming of the stations (although unlicensed) was tolerated because of its nonpolitical content. With the addition of political (and anti-Lucan) programming, local defense forces have been directed to shut the stations down. [Challenge 43]
