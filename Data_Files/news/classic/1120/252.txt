MORA/SPINWARD MARCHES (3124 AA99AC7-F) DATE 252-1120 
Archduke Norris today officially named Mora as the capital world of the provisional government of the Domain of Deneb. 

"From this beautiful world, we will together be able to build outward, beyond our current borders, toward the full Imperium as we once knew it," Norris said in prepared remarks. 

Mora, already the capital of the sector and subsector, is expected to undergo a healthy increase in employment and construction to keep up with its new responsibilities. 

The cebtral location of MORA within the Domain of Deneb was seen by analysts as a principal reason for the move. 

The duchess of Delphine was represented at the ceremonies by her grandniece, Elane, next in line to rule Mora itself. [Challenge 47]
