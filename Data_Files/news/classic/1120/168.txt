KNABBIB/CORE (2115 A331758-F) Date: 168-1120 
Julian Trane, distinguished professor of interstellar history, was arrested yesterday on treasonous publication charges by agents of the Emperor Lucan. 

Trane's epic historical work, The Inevitability of Night,/I> was published clandestinely despite a ban by the Imperial Ministry of Information. That publication led to his arrest on a charge of treasonous publication. 

The Inevitability of Night hypothesizes that interstellar civilization progrssses through a continuing cycle of expansion and regression fueled by economic and technological factors which cannot be avoided by any intelligent culture. 

In his last interview before his detention, Professor Trane commented he saw parallels between the beginning years of the Long Night and the present Rebellion. 

Imperial authorities refused to comment. [Challenge 44]
