Speculation and rumors about Duchess Margaret's children continue to flood the local press. 

Dr. Bakala Setree, a physician with over 40 years of service in the duchess' household, claims that therecent birth of twins was a result of artificial insemination. 

The father of the children, according to Dr. Setree, is the late Emperor Strephon. 

Dr. Setree said Duchess Margaret will soon file a petition with the Moot to act as regent in behalf of her daughter, Julia Iphenenia Cassir Tukera, who as the direct descendent of Strephon would be next in line for the throne. 

Spokesmen for the duchess refuse to confirm or deny Setree's allegations. Neither of the children has been seen in public since their birth, but holorecordings of the twins have been released. [Challenge 46]
