TERRA/SOLOMANI RIM/SOL (1827 A867A69-F) DATE: 159-1120 
An archaeologist helping with the restoration of the Cheops Historical Site has found the oldest Terran writing known. 

Dr. Daniel d'Aidre announced today that cave paintings found in the excavation date back 23,000 years. No translation has yet been made, but the marks and designs clearly point to their being writing, probably for use in a religious ceremony. 

The Cheops Historical Site, under the care of the Terran Historical Administration, was flooded in 1106 when terrorists destroyed a dike holding back the waters of the Mediterranean Sea. [Challenge 46]
