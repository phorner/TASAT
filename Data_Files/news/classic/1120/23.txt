ILELISH/ARRELI (2707 B877831-8) Date: 023-1120 
At the Federation Natural History Conference, held at Gitaaz Center in Concarraffi, Dr. Javin Stark presented the findings from his recent archaeological digs on Ilelish. The centerpiece of the presentation was a fossilized Droyne skull, which he estimated to be about 300,000 years old. 

"This finding obviously presents us with far more questions than answers regarding the history of the world (Ilelish)," Stark stated. "The two main questions are, 'How did Droyne get to Ilelish,' and 'Why did they disappear?' Considering that the date of this skull fits with our estimates of when Suerrat were presumeably transplanted to Ilelish by the Ancients, it seems reasonable to assume that a sample of Droyne were brought to Ilelish as well. 

"As to why they disappeared -- it could be that they were exterminated while competing with the proto-Suerrat for resources after the Ancients' Final War. An alternate theory proposes that the Ancients may simply have discontinued use of Droyne on this world. 

"Unfortunately, we simply don't have enough facts to support any theory conclusively at this time. Our hope of understanding this find lies in locating more evidence and scrutinizing our data to make sure the answer is not before us and simply hiding in the cracks." [Challenge 43]
