REGINA/SPINWARD MARCHES (0310 A788899-A) Date: 206-1120 
The archduke of Deneb today announced the establishment of an Imperial force dedicated to maintaining the secure borders of the Imperium. 

"After careful consideration," the archduke stated, "the government has determined that a special force -- to be known as the Patrol -- can best be executed the policies of the Domain of Deneb in securing the Imperial borders from the incursions and invasions which are common of late." 

Patrol ships will cruise the borders of the domain with powers to repel invaders and to pursue them into non-Imperial territories. Armed Patrol ships will carry troop units capable of boarding actions and planetary surface missions. While the Patrol may call upon Imperial and Reserve Navy forces, it will be equipped and trained to deal with most situations with its own strengths. 

Planetary positions will initially be filled by reserve naval and military personnel. Additional positions are open to enlistment. 

As an enlistment incentive, Patrol retirees will recieve up to 100 square kilometers of land on an agricultural or other suitable world. This is expected to be especially attractive to Aslan enlistees and is being announced in Aslan. 

The Aslan translation of Patrol is Trekhyalr, or Land Protector. [Challenge 44]
