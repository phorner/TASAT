WARINIR/DAIBEI (0507 A889978-F) DATE: 261-1120 
The Solomani Navy has been driven back with heavy losses by three fleets of the Federation of Daibei Navy after a series of engagements along the border. 

The initial penetration by Federation forces reached the industrial complexes at Uston/Daibei (0139) and neighboring Aston/Daibei (0140), and spent more than a month destroying the Solomani manufacturing installations of the system before being forced to withdraw. 

The pursuit drew the Solomani Navy into Daibei territory, where it was ambushed at Sineli (0127). [Challenge 45]
