TERRA/SOLOMANI RIM/SOL (1827 A867A69-F) DATE: 058-1121 
The conclave of the Solomani Party began this week amid controversy as the liberal wing of the party called into question the definition of Solomani. 

Hard-liners objected strenuously to even considering a revised definition, and the rules committee remained deadlocked after days of testimony and speechmaking. 

The original definition of Solomani covered only humans born on Terra. This definition was later changed to cover members of the Solomani race. 

A simple saliva test is available which can confirm Solomani status. 

Liberal party members are divided into three factions: the Humanists, who believe that all human races (because they all ultimately originated on Terra) are eligible for membership in the Solomani Party; the HDV branch (from the initials of human, dolphin, Vargr), which wants to extend the definition of Solomani to include all intelligent races originating on Terra; and the Sophontists, who believe that the Solomani should embrace all intelligences within their ranks. 

Until recently, the inability of the liberals to agree on a course of action kept them being a force in Solomani internal politics. 

At a pre-Conclave meeting at Vega, the Humanists, HVD, and Sophontists agreed amidst heated debate ultimately to back the Humanist perspective in order to present a strong and unified front (with the HVD and the Sophontists obviously expecting further movement toward their own positions as time passes).
