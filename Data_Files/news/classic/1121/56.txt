Sociologists on this world are becoming more and more concerned over the shortage of mwob, a spice used in cooking by many Vegans. 

The spice, sweet and nutty with camphor-like overtones, is gathered annually by large hunting parties who sweep across Muan Gwi's southernmost desert hunting a small animal called the rurge. Last year's hunt was the most successful in years, with double the number of animals caught. 

Zoologists believe that this year's shortage is a natural occurence, related to last year's plentitude, but do not attribute it to overhunting. 

Mwob does not preserve well, losing most of its flavor within a year. 

The shortage of the spice could have long-term effects on Vegan culture, as some tuhuir, or cultural groups, are less dependent on spice in their cuisines. "With mwob largely unavailable, many Vegans in their years of choice are avoiding certain tuhuirs. Those cultural groups that use mwob are shrinking, while those that do not are seeing significant growth. Since about half of all Vegans stay with the tuhuir of their parents, this means that this change in numbers could last for many generations," said one observer. [Challenge 47]
