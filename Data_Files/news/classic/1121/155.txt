Suspicion of a "cyborg plot" continues to run high in this system and has resulted in 23 seperate executions (referred to by many as "machine terminations") this past week. 

The reputed cyborg plot, while still not proven to exist, is said to be a conspiracy run by Strephonist supporters who are entering the Kakadan Subsector from Dagudashaag. 

According to Lucan's local spokespeople, the false Strephon has begun to create an army of cyborg terrorists, built for the express purpose of wraking ruin and havoc within Lucan's Imperium. It is claimed that this army's ultimate goal is the assassination of Lucan himself. 

Whether or not such allegations are true, a current wave of precautionary detentions and "machine terminations" has been mounted by urban law enforcement agencies. Many locals suggest that this crackdown is merely a pretext whereby the strong pro-Lucan police forces can easily eliminate "political dissidents." 

In the most inflammatory event thus far, retired Imperial Army Major Adskir Shormakov was apprehended on the grounds that he was a "cyborg of treasonous origins." Such a charge is unprecedented, both in terms of its generality and lack of jurisprudential basis. 

This did not prevent Lucan's local authorities from charging and trying Shormakov, resulting in a verdict of treason. The death sentence was carried out immediately after the closed trial. 

Major Shormakov's cybernetic replacement elements were limited to a pseudogastric processing system and his lower left leg. [Challenge 50]
