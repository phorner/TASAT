Spokesmen for Duchess Margaret still refuse to confirm or deny recent allegations that one or both of her children are the direct descendents of the late Emperor Strephon. 

Duchess Margaret's personal physician claimed shortly after the birth that the twins were the result of artificial insemination and that the duchess would make a claim for her daughter's ascension to the throne. 

Dr. Setree went into hiding shortly thereafter, but not before changing his story. "Julia Iphegenia Cassir Tukera is the daughter of Duchess Margaret and Count Blaine, but Paulo Trulia Strephon Tukera is the son of Duchess Margaret and Emperor Strephon, the fruit of a fertilized egg that I implanted myself in a short and simple operation. The DNA data that I have on file can verify this fact whenever the duchess allows me to releasethe information." [Challenge 47]
