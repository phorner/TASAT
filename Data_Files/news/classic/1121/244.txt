VAWARD/OLD EXPANSES DATE: 244-1121 
An undisclosed task force has intercepted the approaching Solomani thrust from the Twenty-One Worlds subsector and defeated it. Reports confirmed that the Solomani task force -- said to include one batron and two crurons -- was ambushed by a numerically superior force of Imperial craft. 

Solomani losses were said top be heavy, whereas friendly forces were said to have suffered only minor damage. 

Undisclosed sources within Margaret's military organization suggested that the task force was not a reserve or secret unit retained for this purpose. The same source also admitted to some nervousness, observing that this friendly mystery fleet might not be so "friendly" next time. [Challenge 51]
