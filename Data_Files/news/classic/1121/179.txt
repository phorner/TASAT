PRESERVE/ZARUSHAGAR (2329 E449895-A) DATE: 179-1121 
ALERT! RED ZONE DECLARED! 

Independent testing teams have confirmed the use of biological weapons in the current struggle for the Amavor continent of Preserve. 

Local insurgents supporting the Isolationist cause are reported to have insinuated a rapidly mutating strain of parainfluenza into local water supplies and foodstores. 

The pseudovirus, dubbed by locals as Reaper's Flu, is a rapidly invasive organism that is capable of killing victims within 12 hours of onset. However, the virus may remain completely dormant for as long as two weeks, during which time carriers can spread the disease. 

Appeals to the local Imperial authorities for enforcement of the Imperial Rules of War against the use of biological weaponry are complicated by current power struggles between Brzk and Lucan supporters within the bureaucracy. Unfortunately, most of the former Imperial forces on-planet are engaged on both sides of this struggle for local dominance. 

Ironically, the ineffectiveness of the remaining Imperial administration has bolstered support for the Isolationist cause. [Challenge 50]
