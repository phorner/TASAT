SHAKHAMASH/GUSHEMEGE DATE: 319-1121 
After two weeks of constant and bitter fighting, Lucan's naval elements have driven off the Strephonist defenders of the system. 

Losses on both sides were heavy, although experts agree with the assessment of Lucan's Admiral Rapida Amani that the Battle of Shakhamash represents a "crippling blow" to Strephon's Imperium. 

From the beginning, Lucan's 17 numbered, colonial and reserve fleets enjoyed an immense numerical advantage. Local Strephonist commanders had assumed that Lucan's forces in the Dagudashag Salient represented his entire invasion force. Consequently, the massive attack upon Shakhamash came as a complete surprise. 

Lucan's commitment of an additional 17 fleets makes this the largest campaign to be launched in two years. It also indicates that most military analysts throughout the Imperium grossly underestimated the number of fleet assets that Capitol was willing to risk in a campaign against Strephon's Imperium. 

Official spokespersons within Lucan's naval command have revealed that the offensive will carry forward into the very heart of Strephon's Imperium and will not stop until the "pretender" has been killed or captured. [Challenge 52]
