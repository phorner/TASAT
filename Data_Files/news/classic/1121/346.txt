NULLIA/HINTERWORLDS DATE: 346-1121 
Drastur Kelbis, head consul of the Nullian League's Senior Committee, made a public address today, warning that various commercial interests in the Hinterworlds sector were unhappy with Margaret's new Hiver trade agreement. 

Citing the recently announced "Deep-Space Site 2321" initiative (also being referred to as the Nermis Deal), Kelbis accused Margaret's domain of purposefully and maliciously undercutting the commercial livelihood of the league and other mercantile entities" within the Hinters. 

He also pointed out that Tukera Lines has been busy negotiating preferred port rights along the Jump-1 route leading from Perseus to Pusan (2222 to 2129), Silver Laurel/Hinters) over the past 90 days. 

TNS reporters have been unable to find any statements of disapproval regarding these trade agreements, other than those issued by the league itself. 

When asked to specify which other "commercial interests" in the Hinters had voiced disapproval of these new mercantile developments, Kelbis dismissed the question as being "both snide and specious." 

Kelbis also warned that the Hivers, Margaret and "her lackeys" (referring to husband Blaine Tukera, private owner of Tukera), would be wise to realize that such overt economic maneuverings coiuld easily be seen as the opening of a trade war. Kelbis urged an increased use of economic negotiations and restraint, before "the situation progresses to open conflict." [Challenge 52]
