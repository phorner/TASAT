STRAT/OLD EXPANSES (0318 A9BA8A8-F) DATE: 149-1121 
A single unconfirmed report claims that two ships of the missing 22nd Imperial Fleet were detected in-system earlier today. 

Alder Henriot, second pilot aboard the Free Liner Sojourner, insists that he became aware of the two vessels while conducting routine maintenance testing of his ship's densitometers. 

The two ships were tentatively identified as an ED-15 destroyer escort and an EM-13 missile escort. A fragmentary reception of the latter's transponder signal suggests that the identification is accurate, since the vessel's call codes matches that assigned to the INS Zuni, an EM-13 that is listed as being in service with the 22nd Imperial Fleet. 

Upon becoming aware of their detection, both vessels maneuvered away at high speed. Subsequent scans suggested that they jumped out-system soon after. 

Local naval authorities could not be reached for comment. [Challenge 50]
