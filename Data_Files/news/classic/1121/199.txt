MEDURMA/DAGUDASHAAG DATE: 199-1121 
After a week of scattered reports, it seems that the forces of Emperor Lucan have dealt a major defeat to the remaining naval assets of Strephon's Imperium. 

Captain Pradnir Kulshugirii of the 50,000-tonne armored cruiser Skagerrak (which recently arrived for repair and refitting), was given permission by the Imperial Censor Bureau to recount several incidents of the fighting that he and his ship had been in. 

"Squadrons were going away in bunches," Kulshugirii said, "and most of those bunches belonged to the enemy. Strephon's traitorous thugs are losing heart. Even their officers are starting to admit that they know the real Strephon is dead. They weren't willing to stand their ground and die fighting -- that's the sign of a lost cause." 

Captain Kulshugirii refused to comment on rumors that suggested Lucan's forces enjoyed a numerical superiority of more than 3:1 in the engagements, which were mostly fought along the spinward edge of the Dagudashaag sector. [Challenge 51]
