ANAXIAS/DELPHI DATE: 206-1121 
Treason within Tukera Lines has dampened the high spirits and even higher securities trading that has spread throughout Margaret's domain since the so-called Hiver Deal concluded last month. 

The empress' nephew, Tancred von Harrer, explained that an assassination plot against Margaret had come to the attention of Blaine Tukera, owner of the megacorporation and Margaret's husband. 

Although no further specifics were offered, expert observers speculate that the conspirators were members of the Vermene, the Tukera intelligence agency. 

The Vermene has fallen into increasing disfavor here at the court on Anaxia, and the empress has expressed an interest in disbanding the agency in favor of a new intelligence service. [Challenge 51]
