ANAXIAS/DELPHI DATE: 187-1121 
In her first official public appearance since the birth of her children, Margaret announced that after two years of negotiation, a major trade agreement had been reached with the Hivers. 

This agreement is said to have a net value of 100 trillion credits annually and is rumored to involve the acquisition of advanced communication technologies and medical automation. 

Tukera Lines has been contracted to ferry Hiver buyers from their homeworlds in Spica sector through the Hinterworlds and finally on to Massalia as they gather shipments bound for Hiver markets. 

This represents a major diplomatic coup for Margaret -- it affords her new economic power in the region and effectively sidesteps the Imperial-Hiver trade route via Beyerly's Path, which was lost due to Solomani gains in the Old Expanses. 

Trading in the Anaxian Securities Exchange was suspended three hours early, closing with a gain of 572 points. Economic experts observed that the steep climb in trading was likely to continue unabted the next day. 

Tukera stock closed at an all-time high of 194.32 credits per share. [Challenge 51]
