Forcers from Lucan's Imperium have gained absolute control of this high-population world after three days of fierce planetside and orbital fighting. 

The naval and ground forces of Strephon's Imperium were overwhelmed by the size of this assault, which seems to be the leading edge of a major offensive. 

Expert observers estimate that Strephon's forces suffered heavy losses during the fighting, includfing two BatRons, at least four CruRons, and an unspecified number of carriers and escorts. Lucan's losses are unknown but are believed to be considerably lighter. 

The only announcement made thus far by the Lucan's occupying forces assured the general population that their "liberation from the pretender Stephon's yoke" is permasnent and that a "great number" of assets are committed to ending the existence of his "illegitimate Imperium" in the adjoining Gushemege sector. 

Spokesmen for Strephon's faction planned an underground press conference in response, but never arrived at the designated site. No explanations were recieved. [Challenge 52]
