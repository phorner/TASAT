DLAN/ILLELISH DATE: 236-1121 
After being locked in debate for more than a year and a half, leaders of the Virasan faith of Dlan has decreed that dying a nonviolent death on Dlan itself is no longer a requirement that must be met if a believer is to attain full revelation in the afterlife. They designated as martyrs all Virasans who have died off-planet while conducting essential business. 

Many members of the Synod have denounced the 457th Khanu and claimed that they no longer speak for the true Virasan faith. 

Despite being a native Dlani, Emperor Dulinor is not a member of the Virasan faith. However rumors mount regarding his interest in its tenets. [Challenge 51]
