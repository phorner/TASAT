ATUDEW/CORRIDOR (2810 C595000-8) DATE: 326-1121 
The independent seeker KeLlananae Tourz Agud was disabled by planetary defenses during its final approach to Atudew yesterday after traffic control reported it as an "unidentified vessel of Vargr origin." 

Automated defenses rated the seeker hostile and fired upon it before the system defense boat Gaa Khiu was able to respond and make a positive identification. 

The KeLlananae Tourz Agud was identified as the former Jewell of Corridor, an indepndent prospecting vessel operated by Gordon Irakakigka, a human of mixed-Vilani descent. There were no casualties reported in the incident, but port authority officials described Irakakigka's reaction to the incident as "impassioned." The KeLlananae Tourz Agud underwent minor repairs and continued on its way. [Challenge 52]
