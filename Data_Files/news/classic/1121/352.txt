PHALN/GUSHEMEGE DATE: 352-1121 
After almost a month of intense fighting, local units of Strephon's Imperium surrendered to Lucan's forces here on Phaln. 

There was little joy among Lucan's command staff, who have lost over 350,000 men in the fighting. 

Although the Strephonists fared little better, their stiff resistance has blunted the two-pronged Gushemege campaign, which Lucan's general staff has dubbed the "Extermination Offensive" (referring to its intended ovbjective of eliminating Strephon's Imperium). 

Naval spokespersons refused to comment on rumors that the offensive has so battered the nearby systems that it has become impossible to repair even minor battle damage due to the destruction of suitable starport facilities. 

There are also unconfirmed rumors of disproportionate losses in TankRon assets. 

These various factors suggest that the recent decline in the pace of the Extermination Offensive may in fact portend a complete standstill. 

If this were to be the case, it is unknown how long Lucan's forces could remain on site, given their already overextended logistical situation. [Challenge 52]
