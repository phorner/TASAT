USON/MASSAILIA (0717 A6847CD-C) DATE: 090-1121 
In an agreement announced here today, Hortalez et Cie has agreed to a major exchange of assets with the Vilani megacorporations Sharurshid and Naasirka. 

Most of Hortalez's new acquisitions are located in the Daibei, Diaspora, and Massilia sectors. These assets include factories, shipyards, industrial real estate, power plants, and space facilities. 

In exchange, Hortalez relinquished various holdings in Vland sector. It also liquidated an undisclosed portion of its sjhareholding position in the two Vilani megacorporations. 

"This marks a new era in cooperation between megacorporations," said Hortalez's senior portfolio director, Nils Peterson. 

"We and our Vilani peers will now enjoy more control in our respective spheres of primary influence. This concentration of commercial interests into smaller astrographic regions ensures continued economic security and health for the Imperium." 

Senoir Director Petersen denied suggestions that the exchanges had been motivated by fears that assets further from megacorporate security bases are more susceptible to nationalization proceedings. He cited corporate communications and control difficulties as the major factor behind the move to divest such holdings. [Challenge 49]
