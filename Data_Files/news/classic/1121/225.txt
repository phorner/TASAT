MUAN GWI/SOLOMANI RIM DATE: 225-1121 
Solomani sabotage may be involved in the shortage of the important Vegan spice mwob, according to a statement from the Imperial Ministry of Justice, in cooperation with Vegan nationals. 

Chemical analyses of the natural mwob sources began when it was determined that the lack of the spice would reduce the number of Vegans entering the technically oriented tuhuir. 

By influencing the selection of tuhuir -- the Vegan equivalent of an extended family -- Solomani operatives may be trying to breed a more easily conquered, more pliant Vegan society. [Challenge 51]
