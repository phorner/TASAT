In a wholly unanticipated public statement, Emperor Lucan announced that as of 080-1121, High Sylean be the only language spoken during Imperial audiences. 

This decree not only applies to the emperor's loyal subjects, but to all foriegn dignitaries as well. 

The emperor explained that this decree is intended "to honor my Sylean subjects, who have remained loyal throughout this crisis. The other great languages of the Imperium are no longer spoken only by my subjects. They are spoken by traitors as well. 

"I will not hear such languages in my chambers." 

Lucan's minister of protocol, Sarir Gormakii, was dismissed the day before the decree was issued. Official spokesmen for the throne denied any connection between the events. [Challenge 49]
