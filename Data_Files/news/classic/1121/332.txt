AMDANI/DAIBEI DATE: 332-1121 
In an ill-timed blow to the fortunes of Strephon's war-wracked Imperium, the Imperial Regency of Intelligence and Security announced today that Strephon's claim to the Iridium Throne has been officially disallowed and, therefore, formally declared void. 

Regents from IRIS were compelled to eliminate the individual who claims himself to be the "real" Strephon when they were denied permission to conduct a number of routine tests. These test are required of all would-be successors in order to determine the validity of their claims. The tests are designed to discover if the test subject is either a robot or a cloned entity. 

This news was delivered by Senoir Regent Irena Thorfel, who had been presumed lost in the tragic (and still unexplained) Metternich explosion which occurred just outside Sharim (Gushemege sector) Downport airspace several months ago. 

Thorfel refused to explain how she survived this disaster which, according to official reports, claimed the lives of all hands and passengers aboard the Metternich. 

However, she did make a number of pointed remarks suggesting Ziru Sirkaan involvement in the incident. "I am sure that various individuals on Vland are now happy that the Metternich incident didn't prevent me from delivering my findings. With the supposed-Strephon's claim now formally disallowed, a number of powerful Vilani commercial entities will find their own interests easier to pursue. It's a pity -- and quite ironic -- they felt it necessary to ensure this favorable result by attempts at sabotage." [Challenge 52]
