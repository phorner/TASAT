ELEUSIS/SOLOMANI RIM (2109 A789831-E) DATE: 118-1121 
Breaking a long silence regarding the activities of the Imperial Regency of Intelligence and Security, naval spokespeople revealed that they had been surprised to discover that the primary IRIS enclave here on Eleusis has apparently been abandoned. 

In a terse statement, Admiral Ensuk'kil said, "The Regency is a sham, and everyone knows it. They ran away from Capital when they were needed most, and now they've run away again. God knows where they've gone, but they'd better stay hidden. The emperor's patience has run out." 

The admiral's comment regarding Emperor Lucan's patience refers to the fact that the Regency is responsible for confirming legal successors to the Iridium Throne and that it has already spent more than four years considering Lucan's claim. 

Sources within the navy (which must remain anonymous) suggest that there is a connection between Lucan's loss of patience and the two BatRons that accompanied Admiral Ensuk'kli in his search for the IRIS enclave. The admiral declined to comment on this topic. 

Most local officials were surprised to learn of IRIS's sudden disappearance. 

They had expected the regency to continue its persistent (if futile) attempts to establish a Rim Concordiat dedicated to negotiating a truce with the Solomani. 

A 60-day cease-fire in 1117 had previously been the extent of the regency's diplomatic achievements in the sector to date. [Challenge 49]
