SHARIM/GUSHEMEGE DATE: 281-1121 
An explosion of undetermined origin destroyed the jump-6, Fast Fleet-class courier Metternich today, just two minutes after it cleared Sharim Downport's airspace. All hands were lost. 

Observers and sensor operators at Sharim Downport report that the explosion in the forward area near the bridge. The Fast Fleet-class courier is not equipped to carry explosive or inflammable substances in this area. Local experts are therefore expressing some concern that the explosion may have been the result of sabotage. 

The Metternich was under special registry to the Imperial Regency of Intelligence and Security and was heading rimward after completing a mission within the borders of Strephon's Imperium. The nature of the mission has not been disclosed. However, local officials speaking under guarantees of anonymity revealed that Senior Regent Irena Thorfel had arrived on planet with the ship and may have been on board at the time of the explosion. 

Despite bitter feelings toward the regency, local spokespersons for Lucan's Imperium denied any involvement, as did representatives for Dulinor and Strephon. There has been no comment from the sizeable minority that supports the Ziru Sirkaa. [Challenge 52]
