Dentus/Regina (0601-C979500-A) Date: 032-1111 
Vice-Admiral Elphinstone's staff announced that the last members of a small group of Vargr renegades are still at large in the Spinward Marches. These renegades are the remnants of hostile Vargr units which refused to surrender upon the withdrawal of the Vargr from the recent war. 

A spokesman reports that approximately 20 Vargr and two starships managed to elude pursuing forces and escape capture after the destruction of a hidden resupply base, located on a small planetoid in the outer orbit of the Heya system (Regina 0802). "The vessels were unarmed transports," reported Captain Bolinghurst of the Admiral's staff, "and pose no serious threat to shipping. Despite this, the Regina subsector remains under martial law until we can kill or capture the last of these criminals." [JTAS #23]
