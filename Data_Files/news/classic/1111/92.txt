"This is not uncommon after a war," a spokesman for the Admiralty stated. "Some personality types get so keyed up that it takes them time to settle down again. Anyway, a lot of these people were criminals before the war, and are simply returning to their old occupation with some new equipment." 

The Imperial government has declared Regina, Jewell, and Lanth subsectors to be amber travel zones. All other Imperial territories in the Spinward Marches revert to their pre-war travel classifications. [JTAS #23]
