In a report made available today by usually reliable sources inside the Imperial government, it was revealed that, in the last weeks before the signing of a separate peace between the Imperium and the Sword Worlds, several deep-penetration raids on the industrial worlds of Gram and Sacnoth severely damaged major naval installations and manufacturing capacity. 

The Imperial government is reported to have rejected requests from Sword World negotiators for financial and technical assistance in rebuilding the ruined facilities. [JTAS #22]
