A group of renegade Vargr operating as freebooters in the Spinward Marches continues to elude capture. Despite reassurances by Naval spokesmen that they pose no serious threat to shipping in the region, insurance rates for vessels operating in the sector remain at their war level. 

When questioned about the reasons behind this, a representative of Hortalez et Cie (who underwrite a major fraction of mercantile surety policies in the sector) agreed to comment briefly. Hortelez, feels that although no ships have been lost to the Vargr after the destruction of the renegades' resupply base in the Heya system, "a number of unexplained or incompletely explained disappearances have given us cause for some concern." 

Asked if they felt the Imperial Navy was not doing its job properly, the Hortalez spokesman responded: "We believe that the Navy is doing all that can be reasonably expected under the circumstances. We are merely exercising caution until it is verified that the renegades have been dealt with. This action is not a reflection on the Navy. We are merely acting in the best interests of our stockholders by keeping our risks at a minimum." [JTAS #24]
