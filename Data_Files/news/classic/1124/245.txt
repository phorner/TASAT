HICE/DIASPORA (2920 A795222-E) DATE: 345-1124 
In one of the bitterest blows of the Black War yet to befall the Diaspora Sector, Solomani forces launched an attack on Hice's class A starport using thermonuclear weapons. This attack completely destroyed the starport and, it is believed, killed a substantial portion of Hice's populace. 

According to a source in Margaret's Navy, Hice was not targeted because of any inherent value, but rather because of its location near the Solomani frontier and its high-quality starport. "It was like a dagger pointed at their operations in the Promise and Khulam Subsectors. We had been staging forces out of Hice right in their front yard to keep an eye on their activities and threaten any movements they made. By removing Hice, they've improved their ability to operate unhindered." 

Tentative estimates by local Travellers' Aid Society officials indicate that Hice will now be listed as X795122-E. [Challenge 61]
