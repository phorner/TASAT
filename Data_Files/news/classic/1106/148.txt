Efate/Regina (0105-A646930-D) Date: 148-1106 
Reliable sources in the defense establishment have admitted in private that the Imperial Army's 1197th Separate Light Infantry Brigade has been engaged in counter-insurgency operations in the Vandere district of Kormoron (Efate's northern continent) for the last eight months. When asked to comment on Rear-Admiral Lord Santanocheev's recent claim that no Imperial army or marine units had been committed, they declined. One official did explain, however, that the brigade was only employed in mopping up operations and had been inserted only to allow rotation of indigenous troops out of combat. "Once all the local units in Vandere have had a spell in the rear, the 1197th will be pulled out," he said. [JTAS #6]
