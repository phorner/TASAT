Equus/Lanth (0807-B55A858-B S) Date: 204-1108 
Equus authorities have learned that the disappearance of the merchant vessel Harun-al-Rashid was due to barratry, not terrorism as had been originally suspected. Testifying in admiralty court today, in return for immunity from prosecution, the navigator of the vessel stated that he, along with the captain and engineer, wrecked the ship after surreptitiously selling its ship's cargo. The crew, transferred off the vessel before it was set on a collision course with an outsystem planetoid, were offered a cut of the profits to keep quiet. 

The two officers were convicted on the basis of the navigator's testimony, and were each sentenced to 25 years on Equus' penal island. Charges against the ship's navigator were dropped. [JTAS #14]
