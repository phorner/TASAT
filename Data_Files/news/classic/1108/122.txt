Aramis/Aramis (0710-A6B0556-B) Date: 122-1108 
Equipment, records, and personnel of Imperial Research Station Beta are reported by unofficial sources to have been evacuated from Yori (Regina 0510), and are now said to be under heavy guard somewhere in the Aramis system. The station will almost certainly be reopened, but it is not known where the station will be relocated, or when it will resume operations. 

No information is available on the fate of Imperial Research Station Delta, located on Retinae (Querion 0406). While the exact nature of station Delta's research is classified, the information in such stations is in the forefront of Imperial technology, and thus is extremely interesting to other powers.
