Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 035-1108 
In a recorded statement to the press today, Admiral Santanocheev announced that Yorbund (Regina 0703) has fallen to Vargr forces after a long, hard-fought battle. Most Imperial and colonial forces were successfully withdrawn from the system. 

Admiral Santanocheev's statement went on to announce the fall of Ruby (Jewell 0205), Emerald (Jewell 0206), and Lysen (Jewell 0507)) to Zhodani forces, but added that fighting continues on Jewell and other worlds of the subsector, as well as on Kinorb (Regina 0602). 

A representative of the Imperial Navy declined to comment when asked if this fighting involved regular fleet or ground forces. Observers have speculated that some Imperial units have been badly mauled in the Jewell subsector, and their remnants have joined with local forces to fight a guerilla war in that subsector.
