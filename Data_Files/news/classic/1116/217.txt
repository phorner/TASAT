CAPITAL/CORE (0508-A586A98-F) Date: 217-1116 
In the shadows of the Imperial Palace, a particularly violent clash between police and rioters has rocked the capital. For nearly three hours the skirmishes continued, as demonstrating citizens forced their way toward the palace against strict orders of the authorities. 

Nonlethal means were finally used to disperse the crowd, but not until forty citizens and at least three riot policemen were killed. 

A spokesman for Emperor Lucan has stated that the Emperor, though aware of the problem, was not concerned and did not at any time leave the palace for his own safety. [Challenge 30]
