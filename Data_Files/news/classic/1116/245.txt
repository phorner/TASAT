DLAN/ILELISH (1021-A8D1ADE-G) Date: 245-1116 
The Archduke's official state visit to Capital ended abruptly with his surprise return to Dlan and his immediate call for a full-media press conference on the steps of the palace for later in the day. 

After appearing wearing an elaborately fashioned crown, the Duke began his statement with a list of wrongs and abuses perpetrated by Emperor Strephon. He concluded with the startling statement: "The Emperor is dead! I have dedicated my life to the people of the Imperium. I claim the Iridium Throne by right of assassination, and shall rule this Imperium as Emperor Dulinor." 

The stunned public then listened as the Emperor called for a complete mobilization to seize all of the Imperium for his sacred cause. He made a public and official request to Admiral Hutara, his brother, for the Ilelish Fleet to side with him in his sacred struggle to gain his rightfully secured place on the throne. 

The Emperor Dulinor retired to his chamber without answering questions. A subsequent statement detailing the new Emperor's trip to Capital and the assassination of Strephon on the Iridium Throne itself. The statement concluded with an account of Dulinor's ascension of the Throne to the well wishing cheers of millions of Capital's citizenry, followed by a selection of patriotic video vignettes. 

Celebrations have been organized on Dlan and throughout the sector as the populace is encouraged to honor the beginning of new age for the Imperium and Ilelish sector. [Challenge 30]
