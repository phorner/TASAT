Official announcement of Emperor Strephon's assassination has reached the sector. The nobility has also released a statement encouraging the populace to have faith in the systematic and peaceful shift of power to Strephon's heir, Duke Varian. 

Subsequent messages from Core sector have indicated that Varian was killed in combat in and around the palace area. Prince Lucan is apparently the new Emperor of the Imperium. [Challenge 30]
