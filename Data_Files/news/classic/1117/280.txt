CAPITAL/CORE (0508-A586A98-F) Date: 280-1117 
The Ninth Sept of Capital, 400 kilometers northwest of the Imperial Palace, was swept by fire and looting in the wake of continued rioting and civil disorder. 

Imperial enforcers, backed by marines and jump troops, have retaken the major communications facilities and government centers. 

Initial military affairs announcements and reactions implied that the Ninth Sept Rising was directly instigated by Dulinor and his followers. 

More recent reports make it clear that the insurgents were dissatisfied because government subsistence payments had been curtailed. [Challenge 32]
