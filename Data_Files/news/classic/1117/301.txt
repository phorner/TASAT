IMAPARLU/GUSHEMEGE (1616-B885AA9-E) Date: 301-1117 
The Efont of Imaparlu, exercising his authority as Supreme Civil Leader of the planet, announced his unswerving allegiance to Strephon and to the Imperium. 

The move took supporters of both Dulinor and Lucan by surprise as pre-dawn round-ups by the police moved known agitators to holding camps. 

The general population, accustomed to direct leadership by the Efont, appeared to accept and support his decision. [Challenge 34]
