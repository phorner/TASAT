TERRA/SOL (0207-A867A69-F) Date: 037-1117 
In an almost immediate response to the announcement of Strephon's assassination, rioting and rebellion have broken out in key population centers around the world. Thought to be Solomani sponsored, this tremendous unrest has affected almost the entire population and has tied up all transportation and industry on Terra. 

Clashes between the occupation army and the rebels has been particularly fierce in India, where riot police have been unable to stop to stop rioters from looting Vilani-owned homes and businesses. In India alone there have been over a hundred people killed. 

Curfews and restrictions on activities have been announced by the military governor for many population centers. Violators will have to deal with strict penalties, as the rights of the citizenry have been temporarily suspended in the face of this current crisis. [Challenge 30]
