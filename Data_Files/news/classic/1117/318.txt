DEPOT/CORRIDOR (1511-A686354-F) Date: 318-1117 
Reports of a strong Vargr raid on Khukish last week were dismissed by naval authorities at Depot today as exaggerated. 

"We constantly receive reports of Vargr raids, and they always turn out to be isolated incidents of little importance. The Vargr would never dare a major operation into this sector," according to Commander Lynx Breneri of the Naval Information Office. [Challenge 33]
