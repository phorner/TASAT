REGINA/REGINA (0310-A788899-A) Date: 271-1117 
Archduke Norris has placed Imperial forces within the Domain of Deneb at condition 3 - standby alert. 

Fleet reserves are being assembled and orientation training begins immediately. 

Trance Kelopt, a defense analyst retained by the Traveller News Service, recently evaluated the situation: "Norris's Naval Intelligence background makes him extremely sensitive to recent developments, and he naturally wants to take preventive measures. Although the fleet reserve mobilization sites have not been announced, I still expect that there will be three major concentrations. 

"First, forces must muster at Regina (and I mean within, say, ten parsecs of Regina) to protect the Archduke's capital and react to a possible Zhodani thrust. 

"Second, forces will assemble at Mora as a reaction force against Aslan movements. 

"The entire rimward flank of the Domain is vulnerable to Aslan ihatei fleets, and they are extremely difficult to stop once they get moving. 

"Third, there has to be a fleet mobilization around the Depot in Deneb sector. 

"Vargr raiders dart back and forth across the border even in the best of times, and at any sign of weakness, we can expect major Vargr raids. 

"The region which includes the Border Worlds and the Darrian Confederation is reasonably secure. 

If Norris has to ignore any part of the Domain, that's probably the place to slight. 

"Finally, and not mentioned in the official press releases, I believe that Norris will be forced to create a central reaction fleet that can race from trouble spot to trouble spot putting out fires." [Challenge 32]
