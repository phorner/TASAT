HINDAHL/OLD EXPANSES (1422-A754A86-B) Date: 350-1117 
In the face of continued Solomani fleet actions, a rise in Solomani political activity in the sector, and a lack of defenses for the region, a coalition of Dukes within the Old Expanses announced the voluntary incorporation of the sector into the Solomani Confederation. 

A spokesperson indicated that the Confederation had made certain guarantees to the region, and that no immediate changes in local government were contemplated. 

The Transfer Order reached Corridor on 221-1117. Corridor Fleet, vastly understrength for the territory it patrolled, was staffed by personnel from throughout the Imperium. 

Its mission, one it had pursued for centuries, was to protect the passage through Corridor of Imperial commerce and commuinications. 

Although abandoning the mission was difficult, the strength of an Imperial order and the crisis facing the Empire made the Fleet's crew anxious to comply. [Challenge 33]
