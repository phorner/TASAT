The Emperor Strephon stepped onto the balcony of his vacation palace here today and was greeted by a thunderous response which cut short his prepared remarks. 

"Strephon Lives!" 

Statements by Strephon's aides indicated that Dulinor's assassination attack killed a double who routinely filled in for Strephon at routine functions. 

Strephon himself was safely and secretly en route to the Imperial Depot in Core sector. 

When news of the assassination attempt reached Strephon, he proceeded to Gushemege and the relative safety of the vacation palace.
