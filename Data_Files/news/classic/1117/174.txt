The Emperor's staff issued a statement that Vargr fleets, mostly independent but all acting in similar fashion, have overrun much of Lishun sector. The Lishun Fleet is engaged in a deep penetration battle throughout the sector and is attempting to liberate or hold worlds against the Vargr hordes. 

Attempts by the Vargr to make similar moves against worlds in Antares sector have been for the most part thwarted by effective use of the fleet there by the Archduke of Antares. [Challenge 31]
