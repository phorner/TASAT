TERRA/SOL (0207-A867A69-F) Date: 150-1117 
In a press release statement from the Naval Office on Terra, the Admiralty announced that three distinct Solomani fleets have crossed the border into the sector. The fleet is taking a defensive stance in response to this threat. It is certain that when this news reaches Capital that a state of war will be declared between the Third Imperium and the Solomani Confederation. 

The first fleet has jumped from Krypton through Kidashi and is battling Imperial forces in the Albadawi subsector. A second, more powerful fleet is laying siege to Iilike in the Dingir subsector. The final invasion fleet has occupied Scandia, Tawfik, and Melchior in the Arcturus subsector. The Solomani Rim Fleet is reportedly on the move to counter these unprovoked advances by the Solomani. 

Though the threat of war is imminent along the Solomani frontier, people are encouraged to put their trust in the superior Imperial fleets which are already doing battle with the aggressors. 

In an attached statement, a state of martial law was invoked on the entire planet of Terra. Military authority under General Yoshtiru will be in effect until this current crisis has passed. [Challenge 31]
