Archduke Norris returned to Regina unexpectedly and called an emergency news conference. He brought the dismal news that Vargr raiders have invaded the Corridor sector and effectively cut the Marches off from the rest of the Imperium. As Archduke of the Domain of Deneb, Norris stated that he remains loyal to the Imperium. He has assumed control of his Domain in its name until the present crisis has passed. [Challenge 31]
