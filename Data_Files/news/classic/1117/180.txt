MUAN GWI/VEGA (0107-A456A86-F) Date: 180-1117 
The Admiralty announced a great naval victory for Imperial ships in the Dingir system. After a prolonged outer system battle which lasted for over two weeks, Solomani forces have been routed out of the system. 

A reinforcing fleet of both Imperial and Vegan ships is reportedly on the way to strengthen the Dingir garrison and help secure the vital communications route on which it lies. 

In an accompanying statement, it was announced that a messenger ship had successfully eluded the Solomani blockade around Terra. According to the messenger ship, a landing attempt was thwarted more than a week ago, but losses on both sides were terribly high. 

General Yoshtiru has apparently died in a bombing campaign across central Asia. [Challenge 31]
