ANTARES/ANTARES (2421-A686ABF-C) Date: 257-1117 
The Archduke of Antares renounced his oath of loyalty to the Emperor. In his words, the ascension to the throne by young Lucan was, at best, questionable, and since the true heir to the throne is in dispute, the Archduke is assuming control of his domain in the name of Emperor Strephon until an acceptable solution is reached. 

The Archduke detailed the pact he had signed with the Julian Protectorate, incorporating the worlds of Antares and Empty Quarter sectors with the worlds of Mendan and Amdukan sectors. 

The Archduke also announced he would use the forces at his disposal to make this secession succeed. Considering both the Archduke's isolationist policies of the last several months and the other pressing issues in the Imperium, it is doubtful that any move will be made soon to force Antares back into the Imperial fold.
