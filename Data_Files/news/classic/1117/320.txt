Khukish/Corridor (1606-A77A989-F) Date: 320-1117 
Khukish Naval Command announced the withdrawal of the Khukish 984th Naval Reserve Squadron from border patrol duty. 

"After last week, it is clear that the 984th is more urgently needed in defense of the home system," according to Admiral Dwayne Fomish of the System Tactical Developments Command on Khukish. 

Several neighboring systems are considering similar moves. 

When the local coordination officer for the Imperial Navy protested the withdrawal, he was placed under house arrest. It is reported that the officer fled the Khukish system later in the day. [Challenge 33]
