MUAN GWI/VEGA (0107-A456A86-F) Date: 168-1117 
Solomani forces have bypassed Prometheus and have laid siege to Terra. Imperial space forces could not hold out against the Solomani drive and have retreated coreward toward the Vegan Autonomous District. The Vegans have sworn allegiance and support to the Emperor, and their ships are lining up with those of the Imperium to stop the Solomani. 

The Admiralty assures that with the Vegans as allies, the Solomani have no chance of reaching farther into the sector. A corridor to Core will be maintained. [Challenge 31]
