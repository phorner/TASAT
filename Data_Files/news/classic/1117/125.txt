The Archduke of Antares has refused to commit his sector fleet against Dulinor, despite direct orders from Lucan. (His excuse was to protect his domain from Vargr invaders in the Lishun sector.). Rumors that the Archduke has been in negotiations with worlds outside the Imperium were neither confirmed nor denied by the Emperor's representatives. 

Travellers are warned that the Antares sector is a possible danger spot for the future. [Challenge 31]
