MUAN GWI/VEGA (0107-A456A86-F) Date: 193-1117 
Renewed fighting between Imperial and Solomani forces is reported in both Zaggisi and Lagash. The Solomani fleets have apparently been heavily reinforced from the Confederation interior - so much so that unofficial sources admit the Imperial fleet is stretched very thin trying to cover all possible attacks from the numerous Solomani battle formations.
