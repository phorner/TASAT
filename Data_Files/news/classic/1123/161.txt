DEPOT/DAGUDASHAAG (3121 A310244-D) DATE: 161-1123 
This report has been delayed by Imperial Navy censors until arrival at Depot. 
Some minor changes may have been made from the original report for purposes of clarity, but these do not affect its content. 
The story of the elimination of militarily useful basing facilities at Larmige (2709 Dagudashaag) has become clearer in the days since the event. 
Previously the site of a naval base, scout base and starport rated at level B, Larmige was one of the crucial bases in the Imperial perimeter through Dagudashaag sector, along the main line of opposition to the forces of the usurper, Dulinor, and the imposter, Strephon. 
It had been in the front line of the fighting since 1117 and for six years had serviced Imperial forces in these main areas. 
However, due to operational, strategic and logistical considerations, it was necessary to adjust the Imperial lines through Dagudashuug sector to a new position anchored on Iiradli (3008 Dagudashaag). 
This should not be seen as a withdrawal. Rather, the new lines are much stronger than the exposed and dangerous position of Larmige. 
Given this redeployment, and the certainty that Dulinor's forces would have taken advantage of Larmige's fine facilities to launch attacks to further threaten Imperial citizens, the Larmige base clearly, through regrettably, had to be destroyed. 
Fortunately, Imperial Intelligence assets have been able to ascertain without doubt that Larmigen casualties during this carefully controlled demolition were, in fact, quite negligible. [Challenge 57]
