REGINA/SPINWARD MARCHES (1910 A788899-C) DATE: 303-1123 
Zhodani Consulate Ambassador Shterbifriashav flatly denied in a press conference that the Ine Givar are receiving any aid from his government. 
Shterbifriashav said in his prepared statement, "The Consulate officially severed their alliance with the Ine Givar at the conclusion of the Fifth Frontier War. 
"Terrorists are no one's friends and as the official representative of my government, I condemn these attacks as an atrocity against civilization." 
The conference was called in the aftermath of a bombing yesterday of a Regina Colonial Navy recruiting office in which two naval personnel were killed. There have also been allegations of Zhodani collusion in a discovery last week of what was initially identified as nerve agents at the Regina downport. 
The ambassador pledged financial and medical assistance to the victims of the bombings and their families as a gesture of good will.
