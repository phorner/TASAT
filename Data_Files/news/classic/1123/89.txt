UMORPHUTWYO/DIASPORA DATE: 089-1123 
More than 40,000 people were killed in a fierce human-Droyne clash on this predominately Droyne world this week, amid scattered reports of human-Droyne tensions throughout this sector. The clash began in the city of Adysroyo, where local Droyne launched a reprisal against a radical pro-Lucan faction that had beaten several Droyne to death last week. 
The ensuing violence escalated and spilled over into noninvolved human neighborhoods. More than 40,000 persons were killed before a joint human-Droyne task force was able to restore order. 
This unprecedented incident of interspeciate violence has engendered a sudden atmosphere of suspicion in both the human and Droyne communities. Umorphutwyo's ruling aykruskloss (oligarchic board of oytrip senor leaders) has announced its intent to begin constructing a seperate starport, reserved exclusively for Droyne use. Human leaders are rumored to be retaliating by creating monopolistic trading alliances with the world's predominately human clientele. 
Off-world negotiators, recruited as objective arbiters, cakk the situation "grim and worsening."
