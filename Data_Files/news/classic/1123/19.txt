SHADDIMIR/ILELISH DATE: 019-1123 
Unidentified units of Lucan's Imperium struck deep into the Federation of Ilelish and caused significant damage to various facilities and population centers on Shaddimir in the worst of the Black War raids reported thus far. Although various targets were hit, the attacks concentrated most strongly on this planet's Droyne population, inflicting almost 90% causalities among that race's local civilian sector. 
Lucan's forces dropped leaflets and issued broadcasts during the attack, claiming that the Droyne of Shaddimir possessed technical knowledge dating back to the period of the Ancients and that they had agreed to use this knowledge to construct secret weapons for Dulinor. 
Immediately after the attack, Adderly Morgan, local cultural affairs minister, dismissed these charges as "unfounded nonsense." 
"The Droyne of Shaddimir possess no advanced technological knowledge," Morgan said, "and their only involvement in Ancient artifacts is the small ancient site that they have been excavating for two centuries." 
Morgan added that even if the Droyne did have advanced technical knowledge, "That would still not justify the systematic destruction of their community, an act which seems perilously close to premeditated genocide." 
Local federation military leaders expressed surprise and concern that Lucan's units' had dared venture so far into Dulinor's sphere of control. They also expressed some worries about Droyne reaction -- both locally and throughout the Imperium -- to this racially specific attack. 
Ilelish military personnel unanimously declined to comment on whether an offensive reprisal is being planned. [Challenge 57]
