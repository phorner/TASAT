The entire investigation team handling the unusual Nodokundu case has died, according to a report released today by the local branch of the Imperial Ministry of Justice. 
Special Investigator Nowry Vladkov declined to reveal the precise cause of death, saying only that the investigators "died of unknown causes and under mysterious circumstances." 
Vladkov, who recently arrived on-planet as a special overseer from the Core sector, indicated that the team handling the mutation and death of famed big-game hunter Emile Nodokundu had been investigating "a number of promising leads" and that the ministry had been anticipating a major breakthrough within the next few days. 
Vladkov revealed that field interviews had encountered other mutated individuals during their sweep of the Aasharag Outback, the region where Nodokundu died. These interviews described the newly discovered mutated individuals as "extremely violent, incoherent and often in intense pain." 
Planetary health authorities have declared the Aasharag Outback as a restricted travel area. Military units have been dispatched to patrol and seal its periphery. 

Vladkov has also initiated a full-scale investigation into the deaths of the first investigatory team members.
