ESALIN/SPINWARD MARCHES (1004 C565673-8) DATE: 136-1123 
A plot to assassinate the Archduke Norris has been reported through established channels by envoys from the Zhodani Consulate to Domain of Deneb authorities. 
While the plot was discovered within the Zhodani borders, it is not yet clear if the plot involves Zhodani nationals, Imperial nationals or third parties. 
Zhodani information indicated that the operation may be already underway, as several-objects of the investigation are missing. 
In order to speed the passage of this information to Deneb authorities who may be able to contain the operation, this information is also being routed through Farreach (1402 Spinward Marches) and Querion (1614 Spinward Marches). 
A Zhodani offer of assistance in the apprehension of the assassins has thus far been declined. 
Insiders are speculating whether this development could be at all related to the unusual Zhodani naval activities of 1119 or to the increased talk of Ine Givar activity within the Spinward Marches.
