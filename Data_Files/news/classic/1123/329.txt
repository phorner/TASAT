TRIN/SPINWARD MARCHES (3235 A894A96-F) DATE: 329-1123 
What do you do when you lose a 60,000 ton cruiser? Hope that the Aslan didn't steal it? 
This is the dilemma facing the personnel of the Imperial Navy Inactive Ships Facility at Trin. The Arrival Vengeance, an Azhanti High Lightning-class frontier cruiser, was one of five of that class mothballed at Trin since 1114. With the establishment of the Patrol, or Trekhyair, in 1120, one Lightning-class cruiser per year has been reactivated for service with this force, beginning with Azhanti High Lighting, Children of the March and Refractor Loathesome. The two left, Bard Refuge and Arrival Vengeance, were scheduled for reactivation in 1124 and 1125 respectively. However, while conducting an inspection of Bard Refuge prior to moving her to the shipyard, the inspection team discovered that her sistership, Arrival Vengeance, was missing. 
There are currently no theories or explanations for this phenomenon.
