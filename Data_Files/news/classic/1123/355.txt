CYMBELINE/SOLOMANI RIM (2527 A9F4840-E) DATE: 355-1123 
A force of half a dozen Gazelle-class close escorts, tentatively identified as belonging to Lucan's Imperium, yesterday engaged in a brief orbital engagement here, then made for the 100 planetary diameter jump gradient to enter hyperspace. The purpose of this force's presence is unknown. 
The force was spotted by the Home Guard cruiser Durhamon a routine system sweep. The cruiser's officers reported that although the intruders were not operating their transponders, a drone-mounted sensor package showed what appeared to be the Imperial sunburst symbol on the retreating vessels before it was destroyed by laser fire. The laser attack on the drone was the only fire exchanged before the six vessels broke off for the jump gradient. Their identity as Imperial-built Gazelle class vessels was confirmed soon after when their expended drop tanks were discovered near their hyperspace entry point. 
However, their status as units of Lucan's forces is doubtful, as they made no attempt to engage Durham, which they clearly as a group outgunned. However, Durham's captain pointed out that it would not be long before their true identity was revealed, for without their drop tanks, they would not be able to get far.
