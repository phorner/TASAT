REGINA/SPINWARD MARCHES (0310 A788899-A) DATE: 116-1123 
An explosion ripped through a public shopping mall this morning near the ducal compound, killing or critically wounding several score of volunteer workers setting up for a charity fund-raising event. 
Messages appeared in several public databases two hours later, announcing Ine Givar responsibility for the bombing. The message read, in part: 
"Duke [sic] Norris' wish to enter into negotiations is only a cynical and transparent attempt to identify and expose the Ine Givar leadership, in order to allow their assassination by the Imperial security apparatus. We will not allow this to happen. 
"This show of force, involving no loss of life, was designed to show the duke [sic] how vulnerable he is to our power to strike at any time and place of our choosing. 
It is very dangerous game he is playing. 
"We will only enter into talks that sincerely seek to redress our just grievances against the corrupt and outmoded Imperial power structure." 
It would appear from the text that the explosion was not intended to cause casualties, although it is not known whether the bomb's timer was faulty or if the Ine Givar terrorists were simply unaware that volunteers would be present at the site. 
Archduke Norris is away at Mora. However, members of the ducal household characterized the bombing as "an outrage." 
One person noted, "This claim that there would be 'no loss of life' proves how callous and bloodthirsty those animals are, and how hollow their claims for justice."
