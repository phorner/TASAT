BERANGE/HINTERWORLDS (0311 C4284CB-B) Date: 238-1119 
Authorities today announced the seizure of all assets and offices of WebTrade Industries in Berange Starport, the culmination of a month-long investigation of Web Trade's origins and trade practices. 

A small commercial firm until mid-year, Web Trade was bought out by hitherto unknown agents, after which the company enjoyed an influx of capital. It was at this time that the company began specializing in starship components. 

Though unconfirmed, a source close to the investigation indicates that WebTrade has been a front for Solomani raiders breaking out of the Imperium, probably those responsible for the attacks on Ryathian more than three months ago. 

It is likely that Solomani fleet agents bought WebTrade and secured legitimate component contracts with falsified identification and securities, according to our source. 

It is also likely, according to other sources, that, since WebTrade has been securing supplies in the Berange system, the Solomani fleet elements are probably in hiding nearby. 

WebTrade's assets and those personnel detained will be held indefinitely until the final investigation is complete and all the facts have been ascertained. [Challenge 42]
