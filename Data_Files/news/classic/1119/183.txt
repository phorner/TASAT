CAPITAL/CORE (2118 AS86A98-F) Date: 183-1119 
In Lucan's first address to the citizenry as a whole in over a year, he expressed his expectations that the vast majority of the Imperium will be reunited under his banner within the next year. 

"Our fleets are advancing system by system toward Dlan as resistance crumbles before them. It should be within only a few months that Dulinor and his forces capitulate." 

The emperor then went on to announce new negotiations with Margaret and communications with the archduke of Deneb, suggesting that those fragments of the shattered Imperium might soon return to Lucan's fold. 

In his entire 45-minute-long address, the Emperor did not mention the pretender Strephon or the battles being fought along that front. 

The emperor appeared tired though resolute, using a newly found commanding tone in his speech which was broadcast live here on Capital. [Challenge 42]
