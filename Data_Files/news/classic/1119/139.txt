VENAD/HINTERWORLDS (0402 A221621-B) Date: 139-1119 
Margaret's admiralty today confirmed suspicions that her offensive into Old Expanses has been very successful to date, and that Solomani fleets are beginning to disperse in front of her advancing squadrons. 

The Admiralty also announced that their intelligence confirms that many Solomani vessels, independently and in small squadrons, are breaking through the Hinterworlds sector. 

Margaret is making a sector-wide appeal for assistance against the aggressor Solomani; bounties range from hundreds of credits to grants of nobility are being offered for information about or confirmed destruction of fleeing Solomani vessels. 

Venad's starport will be the official processing center for all claims concerning Solomani activities within the Hinterworlds sector. [Challenge 40]
