AKI/SPINWARD MARCHES (2035 B443987-9) Date: 153-1119 
Aslan forces have crushed a bloody rebellion among the warlike Kritin faction of the ruling houses of lords. 

The faction's forces, led by Tyrar McTavish Kritin, forced their way into the Aslan diplomatic compound, slaughtering several dozen ihatei governors and their retainers. The Kritin held the compound for five days, encouraging other acts of violence against the unwelcome Aslan overlords; sporadic outbreaks of unrest racked the entire planet during the long 87 hour night of Aki. With the help of Aslan marines, the Aorlakht recaptured the diplomatic compound, executing the Kritin captured there (including Tyrar) and brought the state of emergency under control. 

The unrest has, however, halted several expeditions of ihatei further into the remote regions of the world, and many have begun returning to the diplomatic compound seeking safety in numbers from a possibly dangerous subject population. [Challenge 41]
