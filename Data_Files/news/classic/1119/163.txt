ESALIN/SPINWARD MARCHES (1004 C565673-8) Date: 163-1119 
The rumored reorganization of Zhodani fleets has been further evidenced by a recent cut in the number of patrol vessels in the Esalin system. 

When questioned on the matter the representative of the Zhodani ambassador said, "A general reorganization of our fleet is in order, favoring newer, more powerful vessels. Older ships are being removed from active service, nothing more." 

Vice Admiral Thurougood, however, said the Zhodani are doing exactly the opposite, pulling modern ships out of the line and apparently replacing them with other ships. It is rumored that the Zhodani may be in the throes of an impending change of government, possibly violent, or putting down a rebellion against psionic rule. [Challenge 41]
