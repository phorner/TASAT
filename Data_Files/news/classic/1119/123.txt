ANUBIS/HINTERWORLDS Date: 123-1119 
The heart of the Anubian Trade Coalition is rumbling with the news of progress on the bargaining tables between it and representatives of Margaret's realm. 

The talks, organized by the coalition, were hoped to smooth over the Gimisapun Incident in which three of Margaret's merchant vessels, bound for the Two Thousand Worlds, were stopped, searched, and turned away by an Anubian patrol. 

The coalition has accepted full responsibility for the wrongs committed, and has compensated Margaret for any loss incurred. 

Future trade with Margaret, both with the Anubian Trade Coalition and through its worlds, will progress at an increased level. 

When asked whether or not this is a step toward siding with Margaret in the civil war, the ATC had no comment. [Challenge 40]
