DURIMA/CORRIDOR (1205 B420ADE-F) Date: 010-1119 
Forces of the Archduke of Deneb and the Reestablished Vilani Empire have come to blows around Depot. Following joint exercises against Vargr fleets in the region, ships from either side exchanged shots during salvage operations. Which side delivered the first salvoes is not clear, but it is certain that further cooperation against the Vargr in this sector is unlikely, a fact which will no doubt hurt the Vilani-settled worlds there.
