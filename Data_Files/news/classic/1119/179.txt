IAASIV/HINTERWORLDS (2829 EAC3AA9-B) Date: 179-1119 
Chorschuv, popular leader of Iaasiv's 33 billion inhabitants, announced today that he has completed a long-term pact with the Hiver government to build large cargo vessels to accommodate human passenger and freight service. 

The Hiver representatives have agreed to gradually increase the capacity of the shipyards from E to B, a process that should be completed in five years. 

Ships built at Iaasiv will generally be put into service along the Alike Run and the Bruia Diagonal, crewed by Iaasivans, and managed by Chorschuv for the Hiver owners. The boom to the system will probably lead to a gradual increase of local technology as well, according to the planetary accounting office. 

More than 500 large vessels, totalling more than 11 million tons, will be built to fill the Hiver order; the jump drives will not be built at Iaasiv, but will be obtained from the Hiver Federation. [Challenge 41]
