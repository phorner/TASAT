TEPHANY/LISHUN (2719 A619DF-A) Date: 003-1119 
The Vargr Gtweng has proclaimed himself emperor of Tephany after a bloody coup which decimated the military government of the planet. An armed contingent of loyal guardsmen, distinguished by their black capes and robes, penetrated every section of the capital city by night, making select assassinations and takeovers of communications/media centers. With the smoke of the street battles till in the air, Gtweng announced his intention to reunite this world and three other nearby worlds into a self-sufficient enclave. Gtweng cited as his reasons for the coup the lack of coordination of Vargr activities in the sector, the unreliability of commerce in the region, and the threat of independent raiders both on the frontiers and around Tephany itself.
