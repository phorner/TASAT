STROUDEN/SPINWARD MARCHES (2327 A745988-D) Date: 012-1119 
The impressive entourage of ships accompanying Lakht Aorlakht, spiritual and military leader of the Aslan invasions, was received today in orbit around Station Five. He and his personal retinue disembarked at the station and took shuttle passage to the surface. 

Lakht Aorlakht arrived on Strouden in preparation for the summit meeting arranged between Archduke Norris and the Aslan; immediately prior to the summit, expectations were running high that progress would be made. 

In the evening, Lakht Aorlakht met privately with Fleet Admiral Tranathiaf, personal envoy of the archduke, charged with containing Aslan expansion through negotiation. 

Their meeting lasted more than three hours, and was later described as heated. The three-day summit was cut short when Lakht Aorlakht stormed from the chambers and immediately shuttled back to his squadron. 

The admiral's office has no expectations of a future summit meeting anytime soon. [Challenge 40]
