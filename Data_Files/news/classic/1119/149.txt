BERANGE/HINTERWORLDS (0311 C428ACB-B) Date: 149-1119 
Three Solomani warships which entered the system four days ago have ended their reign of terror and destruction within the Berange system. 

The three ships have been identified as the Solomani cruisers Donetsk and Abidjan with the support of the light cruiser Baffin Bay. These ships were attached to Solomani fleets battling Margaret's forces in Old Expanses sector and are apparently breaking out through Hinterworlds in the face of stepped-up offenses out of Delphi. 

Upon entering the system, the three vessels destroyed several system defense boats around gas giant Ythhi and performed frontier refueling. 

Obviously well-informed as to the Berange system's industrial base, the ships then proceeded directly to Ryathian, Ythhi's third moon and home of Nummen Industries' system distribution point. After destroying communication stations, the Solomani vessels took the moon hostage for 37 hours, ravaging the facilities there for spare parts and other supplies. The vessels jumped out of the system before approaching Ral Ranthan ships could reach the besieged moon. [Challenge 41]
