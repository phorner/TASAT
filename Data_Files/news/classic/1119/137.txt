KAGGUSHUS/MASSILIA (0402 A442AA7-G) Date: 137-1119 
Obviously committing the last of his reserve fleets, Dulinor pushed out of Zarushagar sector through Massilia, temporarily cutting the Imperium in half. 

Elements of Dulinor's 9th, 41st, and 278th fleets, among others, have cut a swath of systems 30 parsecs long and five parsecs deep, virtually bridging the gap between Dulinor's worlds and those of Margaret. 

The Admiralty issued a statement calling the attack a "desperate attempt to open a new front, diverting our resources from our drive toward Dlan." 

The statement also announced that the incursion would be routed out within a few months, but until that time the area is to be considered too dangerous for travel. [Challenge 40]
