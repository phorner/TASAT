KAGGUSHUS/MASSILIA (0402 A877A88-D) Date: 162-1119 
It was reported today that elements of the 160th and 200th Reserve Fleets engaged and destroyed a large force loyal to the pretender Strephon. In the engagement, an enemy flagship was obliterated by missile fire, and prisoners interrogation suggest that the imposter himself may have been among its casualties. The imposter's own propaganda suggests that he would personally lead his warships, much as the true Strephon often said he would in times of great struggle. 

The Admiralty will not confirm the death of the imposter Strephon, but suggests that careful attention be paid to his followers in the wake of this incident. [Challenge 41]
