CYRIL/REFT SECTOR (2738 A7A69B9-F) Date: 125-1119 
Major offenses between the forces of Dulinor and Strephon have broken down into widespread, sporadic brawls between the shattered fleets. 

The attrition suffered in Gushemege sector have been the most terrible so far, totalling thousands of vessels and more than a million casualties to both sides. 

With his stronger fleets beginning to give ground before Lucan's forces, it is unlikely that Dulinor will commit additional resources to the fight against Strephon; the fleets already there will be charged with holding off the imposter until the entire tide of conflict shifts back into his advantage.
