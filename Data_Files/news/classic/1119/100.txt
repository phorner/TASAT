BENANKAS/HINTERWORLDS (2524 A7A3353-C) Date: 100-1119 
In an official statement issued today by this independent Hinterworlds system, the Benankeen harshly denounced their Gniivi neighbors for support of piratical activities. 

Without being specific, the statement claims that Benankeen investigators have pinpointed Gniivi involvement in the theft of two of their vessels carrying valuable trade goods bound for the worlds of the Bruia Diagonal. 

The Gniivi ambassador expressed his regret and Gniivi innocence, offering the services of his offices to right this wrong and bring the truly guilty to justice. 

It is expected that the Gniivi ambassador will be recalled over this incident. [Challenge 40]
