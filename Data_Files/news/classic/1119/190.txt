ESALIN/SPINWARD MARCHES (1004 C565673-8) Date: 190-1119 
The Admiralty today released photographs of several Zhodani ships performing frontier refueling in the system just one week ago. The two ships in high guard position are shown quite clearly in the photos; they have suffered tremendous battle damage - entire sections of their hulls have been burned away and hastily patched. 

The other ships in the convoy were apparently of both military and nonmilitary origins, including freighters and passenger ships. The ships broadcast warnings not to interfere with their refueling, apparently aimed at both Imperial and Zhodani forces in the area - no Zhodani forces aided or interfered, though they had patrol ships in the vicinity to monitor the situation. 

Once refueled, the entire convoy retreated and jumped out of the system. 

There has been no official explanation given; speculation ranges widely and is largely unconfirmed. [Challenge 42]
