TRIN/SPINWARD MARCHES (3235 A894A96-F) Date: 117-1119 
A daring raid by subjugated humans has resulted in the destruction of an Aslan cruiser in orbits around Dodds. 

Three human ships which survived the raid arrived at Trin within the week, reporting immediately to naval authorities. 

The ships were the Valaderes and the Veiled Dream, both Type S ships, and the Steaming Retreat, a Type K vessel. 

The Veiled Dream has been unofficially renamed the Ravager by her crew since the incident. 

These three ships and three others which did not survive the mission approached the Aslan cruiser Kholstesarl while in space dock at Dodds. 

Scoring hits with several laser turrets and at least five missiles, the Kholstesarl was racked by internal explosions which broke the vessel's back, according to the human crews. 

Intercepted Aslan communications support the claim that the Kholstesarl was indeed destroyed. [Challenge 40]
