ROBIN/SPINWARD MARCHES (2637 C00059C-C) Date: 143-1119 
Today a squadron of ihatei vessels descended upon and destroyed multiple human-operated bases within the extensive asteroid belts of Robin. 

The brutality of the raid left no facilities or ships intact, and all personnel were reportedly killed or taken prisoner. 

Though technically already within the Aslan sphere of influence in the sector, human belt mining operations had been conducted without Aslan interference for more than a year. [Challenge 40]
