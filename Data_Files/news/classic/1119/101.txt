ANAXIAS/DELPHI (1724 A446A76-E) Date: 101-1119 
With the bulk of her reserve fleets committed to holding off Lucan's advances into her territory, Margaret has mustered sufficient strength to mount an attack against the Solomani invaders to rimward in Old Expanses sector. 

Concentrating the relatively fresh forces of her 145th, 137th, and 67th fleets, Margaret has penetrated 10 parsecs behind forward Solomani fleets, disrupting their lines of communication and supply, and spread out to cut off their retreat. 

Additional forces attacking out of Delphi sector are squeezing pockets of Solomani ships out of the area, forcing many to disband into small, even single-ship, squadrons to attempt a breakout to rimward. [Challenge 40]
