GERDANE/HINTERWORLDS (0407 C000110-7) Date: 133-1119 
Three asteroid mining vessels under the flag of Ral Ranta reportedly tangled with an independent Solomani destroyer in the Gerdane system. 

The three ships, hopelessly outgunned, offered only token resistance as they evaded the Solomani vessel through the asteroid field, jumping finally to the safety of the Sablass system two parsecs distant. 

Reviewing sensor data, representatives of Ral Ranta's armed forces have confirmed that the enemy ship was indeed of Solomani origin. 

Speculation is that Margaret's thrusts into Old Expanses sector are forcing Solomani vessels to break out in whatever direction they can. [Challenge 40]
