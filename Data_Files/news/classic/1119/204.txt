GUSTAVUS/HINTERWORLDS (0739 C000525-B) Date: 204-1119 
The Gustavian League, a mining conglomerate with absolute ties to the Solomani Rim, has gone on record as a safe haven for Solomani ships in the Hinterworlds that seek a friendly port. 

The league has begun putting beacons out in several systems to alert otherwise inaccessible Solomani vessels to this news, and it has spread the word through all official enclaves, as well. 

The response to Gustavus' new policy will be difficult to judge, since most vessels responding will be travelling silently through the sector on their way back to Solomani-held systems. [Challenge 42]
