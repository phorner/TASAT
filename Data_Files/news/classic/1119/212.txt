Strephon's military commanders, faring poorly with their fleets against Lucan's forces, have turned to a mass propaganda campaign aimed at several fleets opposing them. 

Through every available means of broadcasting they have put out a plea from Strephon himself in which he insists that he is genuinely the emperor, and he opens his arms to any who will join him in his struggle against Lucan. 

There are no accurate numbers indicating Strephon's success, and there are certainly no mass conversions of fleets or ships to his cause. But the growing body of evidence that says Strephon lives must certainly be putting ideas into the heads of Lucan's officers and men, the very men Strephon must fight. [Challenge 42]
