Dentus/Regina (0601-C979500-A) Date: 166-1110 
A small force of Vargr raiders today struck an outlying outpost in this system, killing three and wounding another seven. It is believed that the raiders are the remnants of a former military unit, now renegades, since the primary purpose of the raid seemed to be to acquire supplies and spare parts for starships. 

A spokesman for the Admiralty stated that such raids are to be expected since a number of Vargr units refused to surrender, and evidently intend to continue hostilities. Forces from Vice-Admiral Elphinstone's command have been detached to run down and destroy the renegades. [JTAS #21]
