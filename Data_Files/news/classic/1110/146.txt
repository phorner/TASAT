Rhylanor/Rhylanor (0306-A434934-F) Date: 146-1110 
Admiral Lord Santanocheev, who has been out of sight since for several months after his relief from command, made a brief appearance today at an Admiralty news conference to announce that regardless of the outcome of the inquiry into his conduct of the war he intends to retire at the end of the year. 

The Admiral declined to answer questions at the end of his short announcement, which was quite unexpected. This is the Admiral's first public appearance since his relief from command. [JTAS #21]
