SUFREN/DIASPORA DATE: 322-1122 
Sternmetal Horizons local stock shot up an estimated 89 points on the Sufren exchange today after the megacorporation's local executives announced that trials on its new Roughneck-class petrochemical harvester had proven to be "highly successful." 
The concept behind the Roughneck class design was to provide prestellar technology worlds with a means of assuring a steady supply of petrochemicals, even if interstellar commerce and dirtside resources proved futile. 
The Roughneck class is a mostly TL6 design with limited TL7 components. Built for rugged use, the VTOL-capable craft is specially designed to insert deep into the atmospheres of large gas giants, where atmospheric processes often combine to produce small amounts (by proportion) of liquid propane and even acetylene. 
The craft then "harvests" these atmospheric liquids with scoops and vents. When pressure-processed, the liquid propane can be reconfigured into more complex hydrocarbons useful as fuel or in the making of plastics. 
For lower-technology worlds without native petrochemical stocks, the Roughneck represents potential access to an irreplaceable -- and otherwise unavailable -- chemical resource (assuming a suitable large gas giant is located in the system). 
Advance orders from more than a dozen systems were placed within minutes of Sternmetal's announcement. [Challenge 56]
