SUSADI/GUSHEMEGE DATE: 267-1122 
Over one million civilian casualties were inflicted today by a sneak raid that devastated Karshai, one of the smaller pressure-dome cities on this world. Although details of this tragedy are still unclear, reports indicate that the attackers were part of Lucan's naval forces. 
The attacking vessels were identified as one Midu Agashaam-class destroyer, one PF Sloan-class fleet escort, one Chrysanthemum-class destroyer escort and three 400-ton Lurushaar Kilaalum-class patrol cruisers. A number of unidentified fighters were also used in the attack and are thought to have been using the PF Sloan-class fleet escort as their mother ship. 
The attacking vessels emerged from jump space just 150 planetary diameters from the main world and immediately commenced a surface bombardment of Karshai. While most of Susadi's surprised defensive resources went to the rescue of the city, the fighters and the patrol cruisers launched a second, surprise attack upon Susadi's class-A starport, inflicting considerable damage upon that facility. 
As soon as the strike against the starport was completed, Lucan's forces withdrew. Subsequent observations suggests that they refueled at the nearest gas giant and jumped out-system. 
Although many local military personnel expressed rage and dismay at this attack, Federation of Ilelish Commodore Satina ba-Rek offered an explanation: "Lucan's changing his tactics, I think. I would guess he's moving to a "scorched-earth policy." Since he can't have this region of space, he's going to destroy everything of value within it. Obviously, an A-class starport on a high-population world is a valuable asset -- one which could easily be out to use against him. So he decided to eliminate it." 
ba-Rek went on to say this "may only be the first of many such attacks -- and if it is, we're in for some very black days ahead." [Challenge 55]
