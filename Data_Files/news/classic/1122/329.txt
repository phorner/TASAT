VLAND/VLAND DATE: 329-1122 
After legal review by various special committees, the Isgiirdi of the Ziru Sirkaa has formally approved the request of four Vilani Bureaux to suspend the remittance of dividends on thos shares held by the Imperial family. 
After months of painstaking deliberation on this topic, the Isgiirdi began moving quickly to a consensus when, last week, a jump-5 courier arrived with news of the regency's suspension of confirmation proceedings regarding Lucan's claim to the Iridium Throne. 
This announcement, made on Anaxias on 259-1122 by IRIS High Rgent Garran Tainor-Hughes, formally disallows Lucan the right to claim the throne legitimately until and unless he acquiesces to a public investigation into any allegations of felony which exist against him. 
In turn, this creates a legal limbo regarding the the title to the Imperial family's considerable shareholding positions in the Vilani megacorporations. 
Previously, the Isgiirdi had directed the bureaux to continue their dividend payments to Lucan, since he had the right of succession by bloodline, and there had been no formal recognition of any allegations of felonious activities. 
Now, however, the dividends will be shunted into a fully insured escrow account, its final dispensation of ownership pending upon confirmation of Strephon's successor -- whoever that might one day prove to be. 
The announcement of this decision produced uneven trading on the floor of the Enlugal Commodities Exchange. Although a sharp rise had been anticipated, many expressed concern that this move would have a "chilling effect" on interstellar trade with mercantile partners outside the Ziru Sirkaa.
