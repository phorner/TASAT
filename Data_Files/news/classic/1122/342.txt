AGARI/ILELISH DATE: 342-1122 
Adeline Matsumata has turned the bow of her 200-ton free trader Madame Butterfly toward the center of the Ilelish Confederation -- and has no plans for returning to its rimward periphery. Matsumata is just one of dozens of free merchants who have been leaving this area in recent months. 
"The only progress I'm making here is that I'm closer to bankruptcy than ever before," Matsumata said in an informal startown bar interview. 
Like most other traders leaving the area, Matsumata cites frequent trade interdictions due to ongoing Verge Rebellion, which has spilled over into the Ilelish sector. 
She explained, "One week, a planet is open for trading -- with Confederation subsidies, even. Two weeks later, it's under full commercial interdiction. So if you've got a hold full of special cargoes for that world, you're just out of luck; you'll have to go somewhere else and sell at a loss." 
The revolt's see-saw progress does indeed seem to be the cause of this political (and hence, commercial) turbulence. With worlds changing allegiances as fast as they change governments, mercantile speculation -- which depends upon reasonable market predictions -- has become practically impossible. 
Although the intensity of the conflict has steadily diminished since the confederation's unexpected setback at Tiawan/Verge on 198-1122, Dulinor's containment/counterinsurgency tactics have kept the involved regions in a state of unrest and turmoil. 
Unofficial speculations within the confederation government suggest that Dulinor already considers the rebellious regions to be lost, and is simply attempting to cripple the area with economic sanctions and commerce raiding, as well as ongoing border skirmishes. [Challenge 56]
