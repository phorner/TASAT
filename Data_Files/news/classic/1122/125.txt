WARINIR/DAIBEI DATE: 125-1122 
Duke Craig formally announced today that over 20 worlds on the borders of the Federation of Daibei are now designated as red zones, according to the TAS. 
The majority of these worlds are located in the Mulaar, Hermes and Dudin subsectors of Daibei, and in the Riftrim subsector of Reaver's Deep. 
When asked why he was personally announcing TAS designations, Duke Craig responded, "I want to make it clear that I not only accept these travel recommendations -- I actively support them. I'm the last person to want to admit that some of our finest regions are no longer safe for travel, but the facts are incontestable. Even though the intensity of fighting between this Federation and the Solomani invaders has died down, there is an enormous upswing in pirate activity. Each morning, I get a missing persons update -- and there are never less than 5000 new names on that list. Much of this is due to the raiding that is plaguing these hotspots right now." 
Duke Craig declined to speculate on when these areas might become secure and safe for travel once again.
