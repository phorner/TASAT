The TAS has issued a traveller's advisory warning regarding the widespread outbtreak of rabies throughout the Diaspora sector. 
Rabies, a disease once common to many mammals of Terran origin (including humans) was thought to have been eradicated on all noninterdicted worlds for the past two centuries. However, seperate accounts on 14 worlds throughout the Diaspora sector indicate that the disease is not only still extant but is growing in prevalence among a variety of vermin and pets. 
Experts suggest that the disease may have been reintroduced from interdicted worlds visited illegally during the Rebellion. 
Rabies is most commonly transmitted by a bite, the infectious pathogens being present in the saliva of infected mammals. However, neogeneticists warn that given intensive hybridization on many worlds since the early days of the Second Imperium, the disease could have mutated along with its hosts. 
Furthermore, hybrids of Terran and non-Terran root-stock species from which they were hybridized. 
Animals suspected of carrying the disease should be tested (a blood sample is sufficient). If testing is impossible, suspect animals should be euthanized immediately. 
The symptoms of rabies are identical in humans and lower animals. After a two- to five-week incubation period, infected individuals will experience fever, malaise and a sore throat. After approximately 10 days, these symptoms will become more severe, accompanied by excessive salivation, perspiration, dehydration and severe pain. 
Vaccination in the first phase of the disease ensures full recovery. Vaccination in the later stages produces an 80% survival rate. Infections which are not treated with vaccinations are fatal. 
Local SuSAG subsidiaries are attempting to mass-produce the vaccine, but reduced transportation capabilities hamper distribution. [Challenge 53]
