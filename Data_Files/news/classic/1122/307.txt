SEBASTA/SOLOMANI RIM DATE: 307-1122 
Scattered reports of mounting violence -- including more than 100 fatalities -- have accompanied rumors that the refugees of the Florina Arcology disaster have carried a new, highly infectious strain of hepatitis into their planet's rural communities. 
The 15 million former inhabitants of the arcology were compelled to leave their massive home when system malfunctions became both severe and effectively irreparable. 
In the weeks that have followed the 247-1122 evacuation of Florina, forced resettlement of the arcos has overwhelmed the surrounding countryside, throwing the small agricultural and resort communities located there into complete turmoil. 
With food and water shortages becoming endemic, many of the communities shut their doors against further refugee resettlement, resulting in several armed standoffs with Solomani authorities. 
An alliance of these defiant communities -- known as the Greenie movement -- had commenced negotiations with local confederation addvisors two weeks ago. Initial reports called the talks "hopeful." 
However, the sudden outbreak of hepatitis among both rural natives and arco refugees has disrupted the talks, and Greenie hard-liners have reportedly acquired proof that the pathogen was carried to their communities by the arcos. 
Viral hepatitis was once the most widespread infectious disease on Terra. 
It is a rarely encountered phenomenon today, having been almost completely eradicated by retroviral therapies during the Second Imperium. 
Occasionally encountered in outback populations, this new stain of the disease -- coded as "hepatitis gamma-three" -- is spread by mucosa contact with, or ingestion of, any contaminated object. The crowded, forced communal facilities that now typify those Greenie towns overrun with arco refugees provide an optimum breeding and contagion ground for this pathogen. [Challenge 56]
