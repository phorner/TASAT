VAWARD/OLD EXPANSES DATE: 151-1122 
Concern mounted in financial markets here today as the headquarters analysts of Hortelez et Cie announced that earnings had declined by 12% during calendar year 1121. 
While much of this assessment is based on algorithmic projections (actual reports often taking years to reach HeC's headquarters here on Vaward), market experts were forced to concede that this estimate was probably accurate to within 0.1% 
When asked to speculate on what had caused this sudden downturn, the experts almost universally cited Hortalez's massive asset trade with the four Vilani megacorporations which had been concluded on 090-1121. 
Although the trade had been conducted and conceptualized with a great public show of amity, anonymous spoesperson from Zirunkarish now speculate that Hortalez et Cie "had little faith in the long-term viability of markets within the Ziru Sirkaa -- a common mistake amongst financiers with decidedly Solomani mindsets." 
When asked to comment on these various speculations, HeC Senior Administrator Nils Petersen suggested, "People should watch a little more closely and patiently, and speculate a little less. From our (Hortalez et Cie's) standpoint, everything is proceeding right on schedule and just as we expected." 
Petersen declined to make any further statement that might shed light on his enigmatic comments. [Challenge 54]
