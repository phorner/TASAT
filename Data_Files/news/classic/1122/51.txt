DARAMM/LEY DATE: 051-1122 
Mardal Soreksen, senior adminstrator of the Empress Jacqueline Shipyards on Daramm, has announced that his bays are now fully -- and exclusively -- dedicated to the production of the new "modular carrier" jump hulls which have gained popularity over the past two years. 
This radical shift in construction -- and marketing -- policy suggest that the modular carrier school of starship design may soon challenge standard architectures for supremacy of the starlanes. 
The Empress Jacqueline shipyards -- high-quality independent military contractor boasting significant investment by GsBAG -- is one of the half-dozen or so starship production facilities that has acquired a reputation for anticipating new trends in warship manufacture. 
The new modular carrier design is based on the familiar battle-rider principle, although it is intended for commercial utilization. 
The modular carrier is architectured to carry a completely heterogeneous mix of both starships and spaceships, with a total jump-2 carrying capacity in excess of 5000 additional displacement tons. 
Although each carrier represents a major financial and industrial investment, almost all shipbuilding analysts agree it is easier to build and service one large jump drive than a dozen or so smaller ones on different vessels. 
This perspective has gained substantial support in the megacorporate and military communities, particularly as the Rebellion's cost in starport construction facilities has steadily reduced the number of new jump-capable hulls that can be laid down in a year.
