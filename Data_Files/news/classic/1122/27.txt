LASHKAGUR/DELPHI DATE: 027-1122 
The 2000-ton, jump-3 Tujera Lines merchantman Oberon began its journey today to the Hiver Federation, marking the formal commencement of Margaret's recent trade agreement with the Hiver Federation. 
The trade agreement, said to represent over 100 trillion credits of new revenue for Margaret's Domain, was finalized on 187-1121. 
Local economic forecasters responded to the Oberon's departure with optimism. 
The speed with which they (Margaret and Tukera Lines) are expediting this trade agreement is a marvelous sign," said Tramina Sorghetti of Hardrashad, ULIC (a subsidiary of Sternmetal Horizons). "When megacorporations and factions move this quickly to put a plan in motion, you can rest assured that they're certain of the benefits it offers." 
The local delegation of the Nullian League today announced that it had dispatched a diplomatic team with "plenipotentiary powers" to Anaxias (Delphi Sector) with the express purpose of requesting Margaret to reconsider the agreement with the Hivers. 
When asked what consequences might follow a rejection of the petition, league spokesperson Jubar No-Dosaka admitted that such an outcome could "compel the league's leadership to construe this as the first step in a major trade war." [Challenge 53]
