HASDRUBAL/SOLOMANI RIM DATE: 043-1122 
Joshua Dahvin, outspoken leader of the Solomani Moderate faction, was nearly killed in a grav-vehicle accident today. According to reports by Dahvin's staff and local officials, Dahvin's personal speeder suffered a field-bias malfunction during an NOE approach to a landing zone. 
The pilot, Mats Skulpfeffer, was able to jettison the vehicle's fuel seconds before the craft plowed into an open field. Skulpfeffer, the only individual to die in the crash, is credited with saving the lives of all aboard. 
Dahvin -- whose liberal policies regarding pan-sophont rights and decentralization of the Confederation have earned him many enemies in the Secretariat -- was vacationing on the Culperna Sea on Hasdrubal (2939, Kukulcan/Solomani Rim) when the incident occurred. 
While there is no official mention of foul play, TNS informants have reported that authorities have initiated inquiries in the underworld. The nature of these inquiries strongly suggests that investigators suspect the crash was the product of a conspiracy to mmurder Dahvin. 
Shortly after the crash, Dahvin named two of his closest associates, Sean von Thuringer and Sari Collins, as his personal policy analysts -- a position which affirms them as Dahvin's successors, in the event of his demise or retirement. [Challenge 53]
