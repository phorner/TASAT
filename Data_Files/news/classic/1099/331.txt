Aramanx 331-1099: MERCHANT ADVISORY


MERCHANT ADVISORY  

Brokers on this world have discovered a lucrative new fashion among some members of the population. It appears that furniture and small ornaments constructed from Howood are commanding a high price. As a result, Howood cargoes are commanding up to three to four times the usual price of Cr. 1500 per klitre. These cargoes are shipped to local factories, where the wood is fashioned into the end product. 

Howood is an extremely dense, striated, ligneous material obtained from the trunk of the rare Howood tree, native to Pretoria/Pretoria, and known to grow on Pysadi and Violante in the Aramis subsector. The wood is both aromatic, and often beautiful, as the size, colour, and intensity of the rings and striations vary with the growing environment.
