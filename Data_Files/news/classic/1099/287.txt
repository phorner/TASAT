Junidy 287-1099: Rocker causes race riots


The capital of this world exploded in riots last night following protests against racism with regard to the natives of Junidy expressed on stage by Mordred Rosegold, vocalist for the hit rock band Veedback. In what was apparently a prepared statement, Rosegold condemned the damage done to the native's culture by the influx of humans, and demanded greater political power be given to them immediately. The concert was then ended prematurely when it became clear that the audience were fighting over Mordred's comments. The venue management decided to eject the crowd from the stadium. However, a pirate video channel had been broadcasting the concert to the rest of the city, and when the audience emerged, they were met by protestors calling for Mordred's blood, and a second group supporting his comments. Before riot police could act, fighting and looting had spread through twenty blocks. 

This morning, Veedback's manager, Rosalita Tuesday, stated that ``while Mordred sincerely believed what he had said, the comments were in no way intended as an insult to the current Junidy government, and the band members were deeply sorry for the problems the comments caused.'' However, certain commentators have condemned this as blatant propaganda, claiming that Rosegold's actions were a calculated publicity stunt that went tragically wrong. This reporter, however, begs to differ; Veedback's latest album, Superliminal, is selling at an all time high rate this morning, and it appears that from the band's point of view the stunt is going to be hugely successful. Unfortunately, this will be cold comfort to those injured in last night's riots.
