092-1099 Regina/Spinward Marches 1910

The 4519th Lift Infantry Regiment (Regina's Own) was welcomed home to its compound in Princeps with a gala victory parade followed by an awards ceremony in which the patron Baroness Availuk attached a service talisman to the unit's Sunburst.  Three of the 4519th's battalions served in anti-corsair action, including assults, pacifications, and one especially heroic boarding action that rescued the passengers of a Tukera jumpliner.
