Junidy 292-1099: Relief effort mounted for Vargr refugees


The Torenlee Foundation today launched an appeal to help the Vargr refugees which have been landing on Jesedipere (Aramis 0601) over the last eight weeks. The Foundation is attempting to supply these Vargr with clothing and basic shelter, along with other supplies. When asked to comment, the I.I.S.S. Way Station staff on Junidy stated that the problem was being looked at. 

Over one thousand Vargr have fled from Gvurrdon sector to coreward, apparently driven away by the political and economic upheaval caused by the actions of the corsair band the Kfouruzeng. The Scout Service staff manning Jesedipere's Trade Station apparently directed the first group of around 100 to an abandoned prospecting camp some distance from the notorious Downport, and subsequently refugees have simply landed at the same site. Many of these Vargr have few possessions, and have spent all their money on transport across the border. 

The Torenlee Foundation spokesperson pointed out that their effort was purely a stop-gap measure. As the Vargr had been allowed onto the soil of an Imperial Member World, they should be considered Imperial Citizens, and appropriate action taken to help them. However, it appears that the I.I.S.S., under whose jurisdiction Jesedipere's original settlement comes, are uncertain as to the legalities of extending it to cover a greater fraction of the world's land surface. Apparently, the details of the case must be referred to the Duke of Rhylanor for a policy decision. Inevitably, calls for the establishment of a full-scale subsector administration have arisen. However, both the Scouts and the Torenlee Foundation have made it clear the refugee issue must not be hijacked for the subsector's political betterment.
