Regina 253-1099: Emissary hijack foiled


Oberlindes Lines, LIC report the attempted hijacking of the company's Azhanti High Lightening class Cruiser Emissary. The vessel was en route to Pandarin/Uthe from the Thoengling Empire on a trade mission, when a group of newly hired Vargr crew persons mutinied and took control of the bridge and engineering. Although the human crew were incarcerated, it appears that a small group of Vargr Emissaries from the Thoengling Empire were allowed to remain free. These Vargr released the human crew, and Sergie hault-Oberlindes, son of the line's owner, lead a successful attempt to regain the vessel. 

In a personal statement, Marc hault-Oberlindes, Baron Feri, praised the efforts of the Emissaries, particularly the leader Arrlanroughl, who showed ``his great courage and charisma'' by his actions. He also expressed deep sorrow at the deaths of his crew caused by the mutineers, and made it clear that their dependents would be well cared for by the company. 

An accompanying press release presented evidence implicating the corsair band Kfouruzeng in the attempt. Sources with the I.I.S.S. (C & L) indicate that this band have been growing alarmingly bold of late. Although the Traveller's Aid Society has recommended Imperial companies operating in the Gvurrdon sector exercise ``extreme caution'', Naval authorities at Regina confirmed that there were no plans to resume the major corsair suppression sweeps of the early 1090s. Several merchant companies operating in the Vargr extents, including Oberlindes and Tukera, refused to comment on this, or on their own steps for ensuring security.
