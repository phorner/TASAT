134-1099 Fulacin/Spinward Marches

Lady Erika Kirama, chair of MegnetoDynamics, opened the world's new A class starport at the start of a week-long holiday.  Lady Erika, joined by Tukera Lines sector lead Sir Bargii Muukirba and Asmina Lasata, local representative of the Spindward Association of Mineral Extraction Labor, each touched a sensor which ceremonially opened dome shutters to reveal the expanse of bulk cargo loading facilities.

In prepared remarks, Lady Erika called the newly commissioned Dale Starport a major accomplishment in the development of the world and only the first step in an ambitious plan to fully utilize the Fulacin's considerable mineral wealth.

Though home to a few hundred permanent inhabitants, Fulacin has recently boasted of a temporary population well into the thousands.  Sir Bargii used his speech to express a hope that the new starport would encourage immigration to the world.
