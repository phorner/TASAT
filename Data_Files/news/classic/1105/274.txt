Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 274-1105 
The Traveller's Aid Society regrets to announce the indefinite closing of its class A facility on Efate (Regina 0105-A646930-D) and the posting of that world as an amber travel zone. Gutted during a recent firefight in the administrative capital, there are no immediate plans to repair the facility until civil order has been restored on Efate. 

In the event that travel to Efate is necessary, a society travel agent remains on duty and can be reached through the offices of the Oberlindes lines at Down-Franklin Starport. Travellers are advised however, to avoid travel to this world if at all possible. [JTAS #4]
