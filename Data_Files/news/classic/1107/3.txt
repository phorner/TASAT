Ruie/Regina (C776977-7) Date: 003-1107 
Military authorities in the Jingarlu army on this non-Imperial frontier world are apparently encountering difficulty hiring mercenary striker units for use along the Jingarlu-Nebelthorn border. For over a year, border tensions between the two nations have been increasing, and numerous incidents have caused the normally stormy relations between the two governments to break down altogether. 

Jingarlu has often hired mercenary units from the Spinward Marches of the Imperium to beef up its border constabulary in times of tension, but such units are largely unavailable at the moment. Jingarlu authorities speculate that large scale Imperial Army hirings in the Regina subsector for use on Efate may be the cause of the shortage, but reliable Imperial sources deny that hirings have been higher than normal.
