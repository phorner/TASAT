Rhylanor/Rhylanor (0306-A434934-F) Date: 201-1107 
Word has today been received by fleet courier of the invasion of Regina, the capital of the Spinward Marches. Naval spokesmen of the 212th Fleet declined to comment publicly, but in private one naval officer expressed the opinion that prolonged resistance on the world was unlikely in the event of a serious Zhodani assault. 

Coming only days after receipt of the news of the outbreak of the war, news of Regina's invasion is a heavy blow to hopes of an early victory over the Zhodani. The fall of Regina could sever the main communications artery to the Jewell subsector, and seriously hinder communication with fleet elements presumed to be fighting there. [JTAS #9]
