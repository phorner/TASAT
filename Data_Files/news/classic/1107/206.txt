The local branch of the IISS Detached Duty Office issued orders requiring all detached scout personnel in the Spinward Marches and Corridor subsectors controlling surplus scout vessels and all other retired scout personnel under the age of 66 to report to the nearest scout base for examination. 

All scout vessels will be armed and re-fitted for service in scout squadrons attached to the Navy. All retired personnel in suitable physical condition will be inducted into service for the duration of the emergency in accordance with established procedures. 

Failure to report for examination during a state of emergency is treason, and a maximum sentence of death may be exacted upon conviction. [JTAS #10]
