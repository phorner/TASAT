Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 186-1107 
The Admiralty was electrified by the reported appearance of a substantial Zhodani war fleet at Ruie (Regina 0209 C776977-7), scarcely a parsec from the sector capital. /the report was carried by the detached scout/courier Wayward Dream. The crew of the Wayward Dream were quickly cloistered by Imperial Naval Intelligence and the ship placed under heavy guard in a sealed hangar bay at Luck Gibson starport. Ground crews at the starport, however, reported that the vessel showed some evidence of battle damage. 

While all naval personnel at Regina Naval Base were put on full readiness, all ten heavy SDBs were launched and are rumored to be vectored toward Prometheus, the large gas giant would be a first priority target of a hostile fleet. 

Representatives of the diplomatic ministry have pressured the Zhodani embassy for an explanation, but thus far Ambassador Shterbifriashav has been unavailable for comment. Although Ruie is not an Imperial world, a Zhodani fleet almost certainly have had to have violated the demilitarized zone. established after the Fourth Frontier War. Grave diplomatic repercussions are expected. [JTAS #9]
