After a protracted battle, a single Imperial Navy patrol vessel has engaged and defeated a detachment of Sword Worlds ships in the Arkadia system. The Imperial ship, rumoured to be a Midu Agashaam class destroyer, is said to have suffered minimal casualties, and only minor damage in the battle.

Further information is sparse, but it can be confirmed that a number of prisoners were taken after the battle. Some of those prisoners are likely to be indicted for war crimes, based on information taken from the sensor logs of civilian traffic in the system during the fighting.
