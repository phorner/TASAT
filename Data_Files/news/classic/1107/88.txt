Scaramouche/Harlequin (A7C6503-9) Date: 088-1107 
As the Solomani-inspired insurgency on this rim world has gradually lost popular support and has clearly been beaten militarily, the Imperial travel interdict has been lifted and Scaramouche has now been upgraded to travel zone Amber from Red. Order has been restored in all the major population centers and the Travellers' Aid Society is pleased to announce the re-opening of its class A facilities at Brogan's Down Starport. Travellers are advised to exercise caution, however, when travelling to this world as sporadic fighting still continues in rural areas and local curfew regulations are strictly enforced.
