Frenzie/Vilis (SM 0306) Date: 260-1107

A Naval spokesman has confirmed the arrival of several Sword Worlds prisoners at Frenzie, where they will be held pending transport to Regina to stand trial for war crimes. The charges follow a recent battle at Arkadia (Vilis 0407) when sensor logs from an Imperial Midu Agasham destroyer, and from civilian traffic in the system, clearly showed the Sword Worlders firing on damaged ships in their squadron to prevent their surrender to Imperial forces.
