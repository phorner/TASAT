Authorities on this agricultural world have announced the discovery and arrest of a number of "sleeper" agents in high places in the planetary government. A press release issued by Naval Intelligence did not reveal names, but said that the agents were citizens of the Sword Worlds, disguised as locals, who had apparently spent years (in one case decades) working their way unobtrusively into the highest councils of the planetary government. 

According to the press release, the agents were to break the vital jump-1 route to Regina and the war zone by turning the world against the Imperium, and destroying or impounding supply vessels on their way to the front. 

No information is available on how the "sleepers" were discovered. The press release explains that Naval Intelligence does not wish to compromise Imperial agents in Zhodani or Sword Worlds territory. [JTAS #11]
