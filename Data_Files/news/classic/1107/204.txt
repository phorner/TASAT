Rhylanor/Rhylanor (0306-A434934-F) Date: 204-1107 
Army Vice-Marshal Adam Lord Bryor today announced that a presumed state of war now exists between the Imperium and the Sword Worlds, following reciept of word that Lanth (Lanth 0109 A879533-B) was under attack by fleet and ground elements of that state. Characterizing the Sword Worlds' action as "a perfidious betrayal", Bryor dismissed any suggestion that Rhylanor was vulnerable to a Sword Worlds attack. 

"In addition to the Imperial Marines on-planet, Rhylanor has 25 active divisions equipped to Imperial standards", Bryor explained. "Even if a Sword Worlds squadron could fight its way through Rhylanor's boats, there's no conceivable way a Sword Worlds army could gain a foothold on-planet. Since Rhylanor is one of the foci for naval reinforcement from Deneb sector, a Sword Worlds fleet would be courting disaster to strike here." 

When questioned as to possible plans to retake Lanth, 212th Fleet spokesmen suggested that no such operation was likely to be undertaken in the near future, as most naval assets would probably be concentrated for an attempt to relieve the 43rd Provisional Army along with its supporting naval squadron, at Efate (Regina 0105-A646930-D).
