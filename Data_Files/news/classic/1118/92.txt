DEPOT/CORRIDOR (1511-A686354-F) Date: 092-1118 
"Continued rumors that Vargr corsairs are massing against facilities in Depot are not only annoying but are doing much to undermine the very real job of maintaining effective border patrols," says Commander Lynx Breneri of the Naval Information Office today. 

He also added that the notion of Vargr acting in any sort of large concerted effort is "ludicrous." [Challenge 36]
