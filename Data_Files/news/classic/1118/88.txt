BELUMAR/EMPTY QUARTER Date: 088-1118 
A relief force consisting of the 36th and 84th Fleets, with attached reserve squadrons, arrived today to engage Lucan's forces here. 

Lucan's fleet retreated with minor casualties, leaving behind the ground forces it had landed more than a week before. 

With assistance from close orbital bombardment, Belumarese defenders easily overcame the abandoned ground forces, who surrendered en masse before planet dawn. [Challenge 36] 

Though driven off, the loss of the way station facilities at Belumar to Lucan's fleet will be a serious setback to the league's ability to effectively defend its independence.
