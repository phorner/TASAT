LIASDI/ZARUSHAGAR Date: 258-1118 
A report from fleet headquarters announced, "The brave warriors of the 166th Fleet have apparently all been lost in commerce raiding near Capital itself. Their short-term raiding on the enemy was no doubt fierce, and their long-term effect on enemy trade and commerce will greatly aid the war effort. They should be remembered with honor." 

Due to arrive back in Zarushagar sector more than a month ago, members of the fleet have been written off as casualties. [Challenge 39]
