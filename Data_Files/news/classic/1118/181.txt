PHALN/GUSHMEGE Date: 181-1118 
Strephon, head of his own fleet, has made his first advances into Dulinor's domain with ships assembled from squadron elements which were retained in service with Lucan. 

The several-hundred-ship-strong fleet is bound for worlds which are seeking assistance against Dulinor and are willing to accept the fact that Strephon is still alive and is emperor. 

At a battle in the Phaln system, two of Dulinor's squadrons exchanged shots with Strephon's ships, causing minor damage on both sides. 

Whatever the outcome, this incident marks the beginning of a new scenario with a new contender for control of the Imperium. [Challenge 38]
