TEPHANY/LISHUN Date: 186-1118 
The newly established Vargr governor has issued warrants for the arrest of thousands of nobles and agitators to the new regime. 

Gtweng, who is in charge of the Vargr on Tephany (as best as can be ascertained), is a former world emperor deposed 30 years ago in Meshan sector. He has a reputation for being ruthless and violent, although he has no particular hatred for humans. 

In the absence of a sector fleet, the Vargr have run rampant, pillaging the coreward half of the sector. 

Vargr cooperation in this takeover has been almost nonexistent, as might be expected from Vargr. 

Local reservist ships and system defense boats are still putting up resistance in the rimward areas, but the Vargr advance seems to have been halted by their own bickering - not by any concerted human effort to stop them. [Challenge 38]
