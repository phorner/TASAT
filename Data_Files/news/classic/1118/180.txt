CAPITAL/CORE Date: 180-1118 
It was reported today that Admiral Count Markron Morone will be placed on charges for misconduct once her squadron comes out of action along the Zarushagar frontier. 

It is alleged that the Admiral placed her squadron in jeopardy by disobeying direct orders and attacking the elements of the rebel 102nd Fleet. The fleet was led by her personal enemy, Admiral Roberta Sword, with intentions of taking the world IImii. 

In 1113, Sword humiliated Count Morone by winning the hand of her husband. Having remarried, the two make their home on Iimii, and Count Morone obviously had in mind some sort of personal revenge by abusing her position as admiral of an Imperial fleet. [Challenge 38]
