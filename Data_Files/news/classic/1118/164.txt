TERRA/SOL Date: 164-1118 
Commerce raiding by renegade Imperial vessels continues to hamper efforts to rebuild the defenses of Terra and other vital war endeavors. 

Temporary Governor General Sequieros has stated that "Solomani plans to deal with the problem have thus far failed" and that "proper administration of the war on the front lines would have prevented this problem." 

In response to that statement, the Defense Department suggested that it is nearly impossible to stop commerce raiding altogether in times of war. [Challege 37]
