ANAXIAS/DELPHI Date: 243-1118 
Fleets loyal to Lucan carried their war directly to Margaret's stronghold of worlds, spearheading on a frontage three parsecs across into the area of Aarze and Keum in Massilia sector. 

The 117th Fleet has done well to hold its own against the invaders, managing to blunt their assault and turn some enemy squadrons back toward their bases. 

Further penetration from Lucan's Imperium is unlikely, as reservist fleets have now come to bear. Nonetheless, the fighting is expected to continue in the region for many months to come.
