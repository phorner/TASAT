The latest recorded tirade by Oekhsos, the violently charismatic Vargr leader, arrived by special packet from beyond the Imperial border today. 

In addition to the standard anti-Imperial ranting and raving, the video included a sequence showing a human mission to assassinate Oekhsos. 

The clip details the mission's progress through the Knouksarrgh Ong complex on Lair, and culminates in a violent attack on Oekhsos himself. 

In the climax, the human attackers are destroyed, and Oekhsos is unharmed and laughing uproariously. 

Although on-screen evidence indicates the mission was Vilani in origin, local officials denied that any official sanction was given the assassination plot. [Challenge 34]
