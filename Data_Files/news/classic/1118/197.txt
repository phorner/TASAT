WARINIR/DAIBEI Date: 197-1118 
An emergency meeting was held today between Duke Craig and the Moot of High Lords to discuss the demands from Emperor Lucan. 

In a prepared statement, the Duke's press secretary said, "An unnaturally great strain is being placed on the sector to provide ships for fleets in distant wars. It is not the duty of loyal sectors to strip themselves bare in order to support Lucan, when other more pressing matters threaten our own borders." 

"The Duke, with the blessing of the Moot, has appealed to the Emperor to lessen the ship quota at this time." [Challenge 35]
