LODE/ZARUSHAGAR Date: 128-1118 
A large portion of the 2nd and 4th Fleets was ambushed today as the fleets put in for frontier refuelling at the large gas giant Muendor. 

Enemy ships, apparently hidden in their lairs for days or even weeks, came out of hiding and attacking when many of the refuelling ships were at their most vulnerable. 

Dulinor's ships had apparently acted on a hunch, lying in wait in the extensive asteroid belt and Muendor's ice ring for the right moment to strike. 

Effective command by Fleet Admiral Nigel Rudel brought the high guard to bear against the assault, inflicting several critical blows with concentrated missile attacks against the larger vessels. 

Further thrusts by the rebels, however, did manage to get through to damage four vessels, one so badly that it had to be scuttled a few hours later. 

Despite this, Admiral Rudel will almost certainly be decorated for his valiant defense in an unpredictable situation. [Challenge 37]
