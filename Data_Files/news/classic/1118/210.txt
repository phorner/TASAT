BACKMAN/DIASPORA Date: 210-1118 
Privateer Black Ralph has successfully raided the orbital Imperial Naval Base at Backman, with support of rebels who had infiltrated the facility. 

The privateer's ships emerged from hyperspace dangerously close to the gravity well of Backman, deep within Imperial patrol perimeters. 

This bold stroke allowed him time to disable many of the base's facilities, seize three additional merchant ships docked there, and effectively limit the Imperial Navy's ability to deal with him later. [Challenge 38] 


CAPITAL/CORE Date: 210-1118 
Word has reached Core concerning the world of Alekvadin/Core. According to reports, the world has been sacked by deep penetration raiders from Dulinor's fleets. 

The great riches of the ancient Vadin civilization, from the spired towers of Twunchel to the endless art treasures of the period, have all been seized by the piratical rebels, members of the 166th Fleet. 

The estimated worth of the treasures is in excess of MCr50,000. 

The raiders have escaped without a trace, and the dearth of ships in the area suggests that the capture of the raiders is quite unlikely. [Challenge 38]
