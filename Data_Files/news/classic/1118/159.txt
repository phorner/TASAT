BANASDAN/SOLOMANI RIM Date: 159-1118 
Several Solomani squadrons have been tracked and confronted by a large combined fleet of Lucan's Imperium. 

Elements of the Diaspora Fleet, supported by the 22nd Fleet and 22nd Reserve Fleet, plus a number of Vegan ships attached at the squadron level, were involved in the action. 

The Solomani were caught unprepared and were effectively surrounded. 

Their dispersal spelled their destruction. In all, 44 Solomani ships were destroyed and three captured. 

Unfortunately, a courier vessel with several Hiver diplomats and observers on the scene was destroyed in the battle. There were no survivors. 

The Naval Intelligence Office, operating out of the flagship Beatrice, stated that "despite proper identification and markings, all commonly used by both Solomani and Imperial vessels, the courier ship was wantonly attacked and destroyed by a vastly superior Solomani vessel. 

"We protest this action and apologize on behalf of the Solomani to the Hive Federation at large." [Challenge 37]
