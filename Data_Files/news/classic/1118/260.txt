AMDANI/DAIBEI Date: 260-1118 
Division among naval officers of the Daibei Fleet over matters of future deployment erupted today in conflict. 

A squadron, ostensibly under the command of Admiral Byron, broke ranks during training maneuvers and headed for frontier refuelling. 

The rebellion was lead by Captain Kristian James, citing loyalty to the Imperium as his motive. 

The squadron made good on its promises, refueled in an orderly fashion, and jumped out of the system as a puzzled squadron of Daibei loyalists, unwilling to fire on its own, continued its training maneuvers. [Challenge 39]
