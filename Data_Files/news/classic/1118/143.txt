DLAN/ILELISH Date: 143-1118 
Several ships of the 40th Reserve Fleet have been fatally ambushed by system defense boats in the to-date neutral Shupin system. 

In a communique from that planet's High Kyefik the "huttmyen of the 17 tribes unite behind the true Emperor Strephon and accept his protection in the face of continued war among the holy stars." 

An ambassadorial party from Dulinor on Shupin was asked to depart with all haste before local custom forced the Kyefik to behead them all. 

The Shupin incident emphasizes the willingness of worlds, especially less sophisticated ones, to flock to the banner of the false Strephon, despite his tenuous claim to the throne. [Challenge 37]
