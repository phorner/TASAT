GUSHAMAD/DELPHI Date: 103-1118 
The fate of a defecting noble and his family drew Margaret face-to-face with Lucan's powerful fleets, only to prove to the world the righteousness of her cause. 

Margaret, under advice of her high command, accepted a written plea for assistance from John, Marquis of Palanthir, a world in Old Expanses sector. A single squadron was dispatched months ago to rendezvous with the escaping Marquis and his family and provide them safe escort to Anaxias. 

On their return voyage, a hundred ship squadron of reservists under Lucan's control caught up to the defector and battle lines were drawn. 

In mid-battle, however, several of the reservist ships broke ranks and began firing on their former compatriots. More ships switched sides and drove the few loyal ships away. A total of 35 ships have joined the original 12 escorts and the support of Margaret. [Challenge 36]
