Relief forces which jumped into the system yesterday performed admirably against Lucan's forces today. 

Another three major warships were destroyed, and another critically damaged. However, fighter squadrons from the Antares Fleet and system defense took several losses, as well. 

The damaged ship, the cruiser Leonaffle, was boarded and seized. The prize crew has been instructed to return through the sector for possible repair of the ship and its return to duty in the service of Archduke Brzk. [Challenge 36]

The Emperor Dulinor has dismissed the reappearance of Strephon as the work of an imposter: 

"The man who routinely impersonated Strephon is now playing the part of his life." 

"Who would believe that a mere actor would have the audacity to think that we would believe he is the Emperor." 

"Now his claims insult the memory of our Strephon." 

"I loved our former Emperor; I was forced to kill him for reasons of state and the greatest good of the greatest number. 

"For this imposter to claim that he is Strephon is an insult to all of us!" 

In later comments, Emperor Dulinor denied that he has ever used a double to substitute at routine court functions. [Challenge 34]
