PHALN/GUSHEMEGE Date: 360-1118 
The Second Battle of Phaln has finally ended in a decisive victory for the forces of Strephon. 

Three of Lucan's fleets engaged an undetermined number of rebellious ships in the system beginning on 328-1118. The struggle for the system has taken more than a month since the first engagements. 

The battle was one characterized by smaller squadron actions rather than being a set piece contest. 

In the end, attrition forced Lucan's fleets to withdraw, after having lost nearly 100 vessels to the fanatical forces of Strephon. Reports on Strephon's losses are unavailable but are suspected to be less than half those of Lucan's fleets. [Challenge 39]
