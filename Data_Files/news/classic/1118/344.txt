MEDURMA/DAGUDASHAAG Date: 344-1118 
The Admiralty today announced major gains against Dulinor's deep penetration raiders operating in both Core and Dagudashaag sectors. 

To date, merchant vessels totalling more than two million tons have been destroyed in the dangerous trade corridor between Medurma and the rimward edge of Lishun sector. 

Major portions of the enemy fleet are apparently turning back because of concerted drives against their supply and coordination bases over the last three months. 

In the face of crippling losses in major engagements against the Vengeance Fleet earlier this year, most of the commerce raiders are expected to sortie back toward their own lines. [Challenge 39]
