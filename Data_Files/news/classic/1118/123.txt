Emperor Dulinor today accepted pledges of allegiance and support from the fringe worlds in the Gushemege sector. 

"Seeing the vast superiority of our fleets in action, and the truth that Lucan is as much an imposter as the so-called Strephon, fully 23 worlds have recently aligned with our cause. Their ships added to ours are gradually grinding the enemy away, and soon the ultimate end of resistance to my rule will be at hand." [Challenge 35]

From notes gathered from the wreckage of the hotel room where Jeffery Long and his family were murdered earlier this year, his publisher has produced and released a draft of his works entitled "The Hyperspace Web." 

In it, Long's notes suggest that he was jailed by Imperial authorities when his investigative work into the problems and mysteries of hyperspace sickness was becoming uncomfortable to naval researchers. 

It states that the popularized research into the sickness was getting dangerously close to research facilities the Imperial Navy had working on breaking the jump-6 barrier. [Challenge 36]
