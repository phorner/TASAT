A garbled xboat courier message, apparently damaged in transit, indicates that Vargr raiders have, through an act of barbarism, destroyed the outpost at Chunwi in Corridor sector. 

Vargr corsairs in the Chunwi system attacked and seized the merchant liner Hyukt Moi with 78 persons aboard, demanding ship repair privileges, plus fuel and weaponry from the outpost. 

When refused, the Vargr commander went wild, set course for the Hyukt Moi, and sent the liner plunging into the outpost itself. 

Exact figures on casualties and damage are unknown. Apparently the Vargr attempted to disrupt xboat passage through the area, which does threaten to communications with the Spinward Marches. [Challenge 34]
