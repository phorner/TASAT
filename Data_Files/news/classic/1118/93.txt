SolSec released today a communique stating that Jeffery Long, recently freed from Imperial prison, has been murdered. 

"The hotel room where Mr. Long and his family were staying on their vacation in Osaka was all but destroyed by a bomb. There were no survivors." 

Though several staff members of the hotel are under investigation, no charges are expected to be filed against them. 

"We cannot rule out the possibility that Imperial intelligence agents carried out this vicious crime against true humanity - the technology of the bomb and its professional placement are very suspicious," stated an anonymous source in the local district attorney's office. [Challenge 36]
