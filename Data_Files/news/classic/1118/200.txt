DLAN/ILELISH Date: 200-1118 
The so-called Strephon's lack of front-line fighting craft has forced him to resort to extensive commerce raiding on the frontier between his core of worlds and Dulinor's. 

The slower, less sophisticated warships he has managed to lay ahold of are generally a poor match for front-line vessels; however, they can do considerable damage to unprotected cargo ships. 

The merchant community is crying out to Dulinor for assistance, but with nearly every available ship fighting in Zarushagar there is little hope that Dulinor's help will come soon. [Challenge 38]
