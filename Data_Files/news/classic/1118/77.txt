BELUMAR/EMPTY QUARTER Date: 077-1118 
Regrouped after its defeat at the Battle of Nulinad earlier this year, the forces of Lucan have converged for a coordinated attack against the fleet way stations at Belumar. 

A liaison robot for the Admiralty suggested that Belumar's secret location must have been leaked to Lucan's agents, otherwise its out-of-the-way location would have protected it from such a well planned assault. [Challenge 36]
