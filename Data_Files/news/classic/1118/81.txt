TERRA/SOL Date: 081-1118 
Jeffery Long, formerly a reporter for the Phoenix Sun News organization, surfaced today from SolSec, following his internment by Imperial authorities nearly six years ago. 

Long claims that his work dealing with so-called hyperspace sickness drew him into a ring of high-tech Imperial research and, ultimately, to an Imperial jail cell, as well. 

"My findings will be published soon, I promise you," stated Long, as he was reunited with his family in Buenos Aires. [Challenge 36]
