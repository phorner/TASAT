USHRA/CORE Date: 168-1118 
The captured rebel vessel Delorian, escorted after being seized while commerce raiding in the coreward portion of the sector, was in starport for refueling and refitting when its captive crew staged a recapture of the ship today. 

The prize crew was overcome by the captives still held on the ships during docking procedures at the starport. 

The ship's escort vessel, the Warren, was also taken by captives held on that ship. 

How the two events were so well coordinated is unknown - all of the prisoners were given thorough routine examinations prior to incarceration, according to a Naval spokesperson. 

Its weapons largely repaired by the prize crew, the rebel crew extorted provisions and fuel from the starport workers; then both vessels moved away from the world and out of the system with multiple hostages. [Challenge 37]
