NARQUEL/DIASPORA Date: 175-1118 
Black Ralph, the privateer who claims allegiance to Strephon himself, has made his greatest raid yet, gaining two valuable cargoes and two new ships. 

The popular hero is actually gaining momentum in the area in support for Strephon after two months of raiding which have taken him through three subsectors. 

Originally a captain in the 66th Fleet, Black Ralph fled the ranks with his single ship three months ago. 

This latest raid on shipping caught the merchant ships Ravenna and Rosetta with only two fighters for escort. Their cargoes were weapons and missiles intended for the Vengeance Fleet. 

Presently Black ralph has a total of five ships and perhaps 300 loyal followers. [Challenge 37]
