NULINAD/EMPTY QUARTER Date: 013-1118 
Caught off-guard in a classic refueling ambush, portions of Lucan's fleet were engaged and destroyed. At least seven large warships were destroyed, and no Antares ship received critical damage. 

The remainder of Lucan's fleet has dispersed and jumped out of system. An unofficial source suggested that they must be intending to retreat out of the area in the face of superior ship strength, possibly toward Zukhisi or Dini. 

The fleet base on Nulinad's moon, though never engaged during this battle, is now being hardened against future assaults by the corps of engineers. [Challenge 36]
