DACHNIS/OLD EXPANSES Date: 202-1118 
In a surprise attack on Solomani fleets in the Dachnis system, Lucan's Old Expanses Fleet engaged and destroyed a considerable number of enemy ships. 

In all, some 70 major Solomani warships were destroyed, and considerable ground forces were captured or cut off from their fleet. Imperial losses totalled less than 20 ships. 

"With so much of their strength lost, the Solomani must retreat toward the rim and their homes," said Admiral Gytanyo for the fleet. 

"Dispersed and weakened, the Solomani cannot hope to hold off our ships, which can now move in to begin retaking worlds lost to the Solomani last year." [Challenge 38]
