KURAE/ZARUSHAGAR Date: 116-1118 
Today saw the conclusion of the largest fleet action to date between Lucan's Vengeance Fleet and Dulinor's Ilelish Fleet, centered around the three worlds in the outer Kurae system. 

The week long see-saw conflict has left both sides severely weakened. The Vengeance Fleet claims to have inflicted over 100 losses on Dulinor. The Ilelish Fleet boasts a similar number of enemy ships destroyed. 

In one incident of interest, patrols of both sides approaching an outer- system planet fought it out to the last two ships. Both ships, heavily damaged and unable to use their ship-to-ship weapons, managed to come into contact and commence boarding actions, leaving only 15 Ilelish crewmen alive on the wrecked hulks proclaiming their own victory. 

Both fleets have jumped out of the system to regroup. 

Salvage ships from a dozen nearby worlds have arrived to begin picking through the wreckage, careful to evade the few fighters left to secure the area against looting. [Challenge 36]
