INFRAPOLIS/ANTARES Date: 177-1118 
Archduke Brzk's fleets have gained another major victory over Lucan's ships in this subsector over the last two weeks. 

Choosing mainly single ship operations, Lucan's squadrons were finally found in larger groups gathering for a thrust into the sector. 

Before they could all assemble, many of the formations were engaged and again dispersed over the course of the campaign. 

More than 30 enemy ships were destroyed in the operation - most of them in the Infrapolis system itself. [Challenge 38]
