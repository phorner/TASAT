LIBERT/DIASPORA Date: 211-1118 
Support for the Solomani cause and invasion in the Solomani Rim and rimward Diaspora sectors is apparently widespread, despite assurances from the nobility that this is not the case. 

Efforts on many worlds are being hampered by Solomani security elements, largely with public support. 

Pervasive unrest is apparent, and a large number of troops are being pulled out of the front lines in order to secure some rear areas. 

Particular trouble spots seem to be in Mudge, Easter, Frey, and St. Denis, where uprisings have seen considerable destruction of life and property. [Challenge 38]
