WARINIR/DAIBEI Date: 223-1118 
Government offices are buzzing with activity, but they are reluctant to comment on what has become known as the Orvon Incident. 

Three patrol ships from the Daibei Fleet, apparently on routine maneuvers, were approached and fired upon by a squadron from the 239th Fleet, en route to the Solomani front. 

With sketchy facts, the naval Information Office is declining any comment on the incident, stating only that it must be some sort of terrible mistake. 

The Orvon Incident is already being portrayed in the press as a symptom of impending confrontation between the Imperium and Daibei sector. [Challenge 38]
