Fleet Command has issued sector-by-sector requisitions to reinforce the Vengeance Fleet in a campaign against Dulinor. 

"We face severe curtailment in ship strength," said an unnamed spokes- person, "unless we can restructure our priorities, getting good ships out of the backwater areas and into the front lines." When questioned about reports saying Dulinor's fleets are somewhat better organized and prepared for battle, the spokesperson declined comment. [Challenge 35]
