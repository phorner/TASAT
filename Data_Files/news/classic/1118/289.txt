WARINIR/DAIBEI Date: 289-1118 
The Emperor's final denial of an appeal to retain ship strength in Daibei sector has sparked extreme sector patriotism and anti-Imperium sentiment. 

"The Treaty of Ftahalr guarantees us the right to maintain reasonable ship strengths," pointed out Lord Guinth, advisor to the Duke. The Duke has prepared a written response to Lucan, the essence of which has been made available to the press. 

The Independent Federation of Daibei is officially formed as of this day, to incorporate worlds and subsectors of the sector and additional territories in the Reaver's Deep sector. 

A pro-Imperial faction in the Moot of High Lords has been isolated and subjected to house arrest until the period of transition is completed. 

The Duke has assumed personal control over the new Federation until a more systematic government can be established. 

Rallies organized by the Duke's household have begun and are expected to dominate the Three Cities for the next several days. [Challenge 35]
