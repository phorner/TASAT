Military atrocities on the part of Imperial forces were categorically denied by a fleet spokesman today. 

"The destruction of cities on three worlds in the Gushemege sector has been investigated and has been attributed to enemy activity in the area. Several cities in that area were subjected to nuclear and chemical attack from orbiting ships during military clean up operations. Though the cause of the catastrophe is still in question, the fact that a million plus individuals have been killed in 'an unfortunate act of war.'" [Challenge 35]
