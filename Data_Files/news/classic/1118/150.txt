KHANDI/DAGUDASHAAG Date: 150-1118 
An extensive pacification campaign against unprotected industrial worlds in the sector has been dealt several blows in the last week. 

Lucan's policy to replace hostile nobles and governments with military governors where possible is putting his ground forces to the test. 

Landings against seven worlds - Shankida, Dashi, Ispumer, Medurma, Dipa, Ekhugush, and Nimluin - have placed the rest of the fleet in a serious shortage of marines. 

"The pacification of these worlds is paramount to the successful completion of the fleet's mission and the eventual return of the sector to rightful Imperial administration," said a spokesman in answer to negative reports from the worlds themselves. 

It is reported that several divisions of marines which landed on Ekhugush haven't actually gotten off their island landing sites in the face of worldwide resistance to their presence. 

On Nimluin, the most distant world invaded, the first military governor was assassinated days after his arrival. A shaky state of martial law imposed on the planet is being maintained only in the three larger cities where Lucan's troops are garrisoned. 

The rest of the planet is mounting an effort to coordinate a war against the garrison, which some in the command structure fear will force a costly and embarrassing evacuation of the planet. [Challenge 37]
