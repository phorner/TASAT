NULINAD/EMPTY QUARTER Date: 012-1118 
Until now engaged in sporadic fighting in the rimward reaches of Antares, large squadrons of the Antares Fleet, with the attached 104th Reserve Fleet and several squadrons of the 226th Fleet, clashed with ships of Lucan's Imperium in the Nulinad system. 

This major clash has for the first time pitted massed enemy ships against the proud fleets of Antares, testing the League's commitment to independence. [Challenge 36]
