DURIMA/CORRIDOR Date: 199-1118 
Local elements of the 58th and 56th Reserve Fleets today smashed disorganized Vargr corsairs. 

The Vargr refuelling and supply bases on a gas giant moon in the outer system were also located and destroyed, according to the Defense Coordination Office on Durima. 

"Unfortunately, a marine raid on the Vargr base prior to the bombardment failed to locate or procure valuable cargoes believed to have been stored there at one time." 

Examination of the wreckage indicates that the complex could accommodate no more than five Vargr ships at one time, and conditions were primitive. [Challenge 38]
