DLAN/ILELISH Date: 137-1118 
Fearful of his alliance slipping in the border worlds between Cyril and Usdiki, where the false Strephon is gaining wide acceptance and the seal of legitimacy, Dulinor has for the past several months authorized reserve fleets to sortie into the area in a show of strength. 

Local worlds undecided or loyal to the false Strephon have bucked under these displays, sometimes fighting back with local squadrons. 

A war of attrition has begun in the area which is pitting out-of-date ships against each other in the absence of larger, state-sponsored, state-of-the-art fleets. [Challenge 37]
