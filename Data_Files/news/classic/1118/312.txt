NARYA/DAIBEI Date: 312-1118 
The lights of Daibei are lit up this day with close orbital fighting between forces loyal to Lucan and the recently arrived Daibei Fleet squadrons. 

A thorn in the side of the new federation, this battle is seen as a test of that union's strength and will to survive. 

Initial reports say that overwhelming strength is breaking down the system's defenses, and that ships loyal to Lucan are unable to continue the battle and have retreated out of the system. However, it is doubtful that the Daibei Fleet carries sufficient ground-attack elements to take the planet without a lengthy siege and bombardment. [Challenge 39]
