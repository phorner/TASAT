DEPOT/CORRIDOR (1511-A686354-F) Date: 102-1118 
A force of Vargr warships, estimated to be over 500 vessels strong, has entered the system today and begun its systematic hunt of merchant vessels. 

The three squadrons of the 255th Fleet left in the system were sent out against the Vargr, but were dispersed and destroyed by the encroaching Vargr. 

Evacuations from Depot itself had been announced, and then later canceled as the Vargr noose tightened around the planet. 

"With the Vargr animals in control of the approaches to Depot we have little choice but to maintain our control over the surface and await the imminent arrival of a relief force," assured Baron hault Grivven. The Naval Information Office has been in turmoil and unavailable for comment. [Challenge 36]
