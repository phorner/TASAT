Rule of Terra

Solomani terrorist group active on selected regions of the Solomani /Imperial border. Violently anti-Imperial even by the standards of most Solomani political groups, the Rule of Terra seeks to force the return of all "rightful Terran property" to Solomani hands through assassination and other acts of violence.

The organisation, although interstellar in scope, was apparently not a very strong organisation in the beginning; some of its claimed attacks have proved to be accidents, while others were the work of different dissident individuals or organisations.

The Rule of Terra's acts, although not its goals, have been disavowed by many other Solomani groups, including the Confederation government; in return, the Rule of Terra has attacked even Solomani populations, by stating that "all who do not contribute to the Manifest Destiny of the Race are not worthy to be part of the Race".

Since the death of Strephon and the resulting Solomani incursions into the rimward reaches of the Imperium, the Rule of Terra organisation has apparently mushroomed in popularity. The group has claimed responsibility for many terrorist acts along the current Solomani /Imperial border.

Absolute Advantage

An economic grouping, such as a planet or corportation, has an absolute advantage over it trading partners if it is able to produce more of a good or service with the same amount of resources or the same amount of a good or service with fewer resources.

Ahriy

Aslan term for the Pride, or extended family by relation and marriage. It is headed by an Aewar.

Anti-Assimilation

The complete and utter rejection of the assimilation of friendly Virus strains into mainstream society. This objection follows the signing of an Extension Coda to the Spinward Accords in 1147. Most of the Regency mainstream can be described as being Anti-Assimilation, a lingering aftereffect of the Rape of Trin, though it is rather ambivalent and equivocal. A true Anti-Assimilationist is one that categorically rejects the idea that Virus and other sentient species can ever coexist together. The most articulate and thoughtful of this group tends to avoid the genocidal thinking of the so called "Exterminationist" line of reasoning, generally proposing various schemes for placing friendly or non-threatening viruses into a reservation or homeland where they can be segregated from the rest of society.

Belgariad Sojourn

Former interstellar state, located in Egyrn subsector (Trojan Reach B) apparently founded by a disgraced Imperial admiral sometime after the Wars of the Imperial Throne. The Sojourn barely deserved being called an interstellar state. By the time of the Imperial Civil War, the government on Belgard could barely maintain what few starships it possessed. In 1120-1121, an Aslan clan called the Hlearkhea invaded the state, and quickly swept aside the feeble defenses. The local human population eventually recovered from the shock, and have become somewhat cooperative with their new overlords since the Collapse.

Bluejackets

Nickname for members of the Commonwealth Police Service. Made in reference to the sky blue dress tunics worn during public ceremonies. 

^^^^

Codices of Sakolusalo: The 64 volume written authority for Aslan customs, courtesies and rituals. The codices are applied by Fait Accompli Aslan to all of their subjects, both Aslan and Human. Contrary to what has been reported by other authorities, the Codices are inconsistently applied, as each clan has its own interpretation of how they should be applied in more obscure or special circumstances. Naturally, most captive Fait Accompli populations are resistant to the imposition of these codes into their lives, and fuels most of the conflict that still tears apart the Thinrim.

Borderland

Old name for the non-aligned worlds in Trojan Reach sector between the Third Imperium and the Aslan Hierate. These worlds were settled entirely by Imperial culture humans, though in a few cases old Rule of Man and Long Night era colonies were already extant. The region was non-aligned by virtue of its economic backwardness, and a mutual desire on the part of both the Imperium and the Aslan to maintain a neutral buffer zone between themselves. The Imperial Civil War led to a breakdown in Aslan recognition of the Peace of Ftahalr, and Ihatei swarmed over the weakly defended worlds in a lightning attack in 1118-1119. Frequent guerilla activity and the locals pronounced resistance to assimilation has impeded the Hierate's control over these worlds, as has continued tensions with the Regency. Very little has been done to resettle or develop these worlds for the Hierates benefit.

Commonwealth Police Service

The enforcement and investigation arm of the Regency Ministry of Justice. The CPS was formed in the 1130s to rationalise the diffuse, and oftentimes shadowy presence of Imperial MoJ police agents in the Antebellum period. By centralising its police services, the Quarantine Service in space, and the CPS dirtside, the Regency made clear its intent of legitimising the rule of law among its enforcement, investigation and judicial organs, in direct contrast to the repressive methods of noble and Imperial police services. The CPS is charged primarily with the investigation of violations of all Regency laws that apply across interstellar jurisdictions, though its charter prohibits operations of paramilitary nature (in other words, no Wacos), and its jurisdiction is limited over Quarantine violations and smuggling. 

Most worlds with a population of 7 or more, or 5 and an A-class starport, contain a CPS office. Industrial and high-pop worlds often have several offices. Most of these are generic field offices of 100-300 agents, divided into several areas of jurisdictional responsibility. Larger offices include full forensic and investigation facilities equipped with the latest modern equipment and procedures, and these render assistance to local planetary police upon their request. The CPS has its own transport branch, though it is prohibited warships of any kind, and its vessels may only carry defensive armaments. 

Besides investigation, the CPS provides bodyguard protection for the Regent and his/her family, a deliberate break from the military protection afforded the emperor/empress. It is also responsible for domestic intelligence gathering against criminal threats, a role that provides some controversy, and counterintelligence operations.

Comparative Advantage

An economic grouping has a comparative advantage in the production of a good or service that it produces at a lower opportunity cost than its trading partners. Some groups have an absolute advantage in the production of several goods relative to their trading partners. Some have an absolute disadvantage. They are inefficient in producing anything, relative to anyone else. The theory of comparative advanatge argues that it is better for a country to specialise in the production of those good it is least inefficient at, compared with producing other goods. 

For example, let us say that Alphatel has 250 credits, with which it can invest in speculative manufacturing ventures. It has two choices, either producing computers at 5 credits a piece, or producing holovision sets at 10 credits a piece. Its neighbor and trading partner is Betamac, which has 210 credits, and can produce either computers at 15 credits, or holovisions at 12 credits a unit. Alphatel has an absolute advantage in both markets, and could manufacture both if it wanted to. However the most efficient division of its money only allows production 12 holovisions (120 credits) and 26 computers (130 credits). By contrast Betamac can produce fewer of each in combination. But if Alphatel were to concentrate all of its money in computers, it could produce 50 at 5 credits a piece. Betamac is less efficient, but it has a lower oppurtunity cost in producing holovisions, as it can manufacture approximately 17.5 units if it concentrated solely in that market. By specialising, more of each kind of good is made. 

Comparative Advantage is the basis and justification of all trade. 

^^^^

Complementary Markets

The ability of two parties to gain everything they want by engaging in trade with each other with the desirable goods as a medium and commodity. An example of a complimentary market is two countries, one with a surplus of grain, and the other with a surplus of iron. By trading their surplus for the other's, both are content.

Dark Ascension

The shadowy undeclared wars between Aslan clans that have existed since the Collapse. The rules of formalised clan wars are rarely honored by human resistance groups, whether on Fait Accompli worlds in the Regency, or non-aligned worlds conquered in the so-called Borderland region. The tendency of these groups to exploit hostilities between two or more warring clans has forced many occupying clans to adopt extreme measures to protect themselves and their territories, and to continue force projection. Most interclan wars are now prosecuted by so called "Champion" Brigades of mercenary or retainered Aslan, or solely by assassin brotherhoods. Trekhyair are now reserved solely for keeping the human natives under dewclaw and thumb. 

This reliance upon units hired for both for money and professional courtesies, rather than the traditional ties of feodality, has had some unintended consequences. Many of these units have amassed great amounts of wealth and power themselves. In some cases they have exceeded the agreed upon terms of honorable war, and have persecuted or overthrown their opposition, or wrested control of their lands and vassals for themselves. Many members of the Tlaukhu are distressed by this growing trend of cultural backsliding, but are in no position to remedy its effects.

Delphi Foundation

Non-profit organisation dedicated to preserving the traditions of the Third Imperium. Delphi was founded in 1134 by surviving members of the Tukera family, and its charter dedicates the foundation to financial and moral support for preserving Imperial tradition, culture and governance. Naturally such a body has been a strong bastion of conservatism and opposition in the face of Norris' reforms. At times the Foundation has been either a magnet for resistance by the nobility, or has limply supported the governments initiatives in an attempt to weaken or confuse popular support.

Ekho

Aslan term for the immediate family. It is headed by a male Tao'.

Extermination

The destruction of all Virus through whatever means possible. This line of thinking was more common in the early days of the Regency, and was whipped into hysteria following the Rape of Trin. It has diminished in power in mainstream society, largely because it is not based upon any clear logic, other than a pronounced fear Virus motivations and capabilities. The unimaginative inflexibility of this philosophy, and its demand of a war of all sentients against all Viruses, also has little appeal to the mainstream. Most Exterminationists are now found within some areas of RQS, though these are generally more and more vilified and isolated. 

^^^^

Fidelis Controversy

The controversy surrounding unidentified experiments occuring at a former outpost of the now defunct Research Station in Fidelis (Trojan Reach). Delta was a class 4 containment facility used to carry out chemical and biological experiments that were too dangerous for experimentation on more habitable worlds. The facility was abandoned and evacuated in 1120 as the Domain of Deneb could no longer guarantee its security. After the Regency retook the system in 1131, the restoration of the facility took the backseat after other existing concerns, and the colony charter was sold to a small belter collective from Zaibon/Lunion. The Regency did retain a containment facility on a planetoid designated HH-4301, but it was a low priority facility until about 1135, when the government restricted access to the facility and the surrounding space. After the Rape of Trin the facility was quietly interdicted, and a large region of space around it was closed off to civilian traffic. Even in that period, rumors swirled that it was a containment facility for Viruses captured by the Navy and RQS, though those same rumors indicated that HH-4301 was a "deathrow" that kept viruses long enough for classification and analysis before being destroyed. 

But the leaked RASAC archives hint that the facility was more than just a safe disposal facility, and that an extensive subterranean facility had been hollowed out of the rock in the 1140s. Given the 156 km diameter of 4301, this is a very large facility indeed. The archives also hint at lengthy deceptive techniques to disquise the massive ship traffic that the facility was recieving for the last sixty years, and indicated a sizeable security garrison to protect the facility from attack, including a regiments worth of Marines backed by Meson deep sites. These revelations have thrown the Regency public into a tizzy, as the extent of the facilities and its importance seem to indicate a major viral breeding facility, or something worse. Since 1200, several attempted perimeter break-ins have been reportedly carried out by protestors and hardline Anti-Assimilationist groups. To date the protests have been peaceful disruption, and the now fully visible defense garrison has been restrained in its actions.

State of Free Association

The formal term for "client state." In a state of free association, the lesser party defers external affairs and defense to its bigger protector, but retains internal autonomy and the continuance of its culture and society. 

^^^^

Free Soil Worlds

Those worlds in the Thinrim that were not declared Fait Accompli after the Collapse, and are under the rule of a government formed on the organisational frameworks, or out of the veterans, of Anti-Ihatei resistance groups. Some chauvinists go further, proclaiming that worlds absolutely free of Aslan inhabitants are the "true" free soil, but these people are fortunately few. Free Soil worlds have mixed reactions towards Aslan in the Regency; most profess few or no reservations about acculturated Regency Aslan, but are cold and often hostile towards "traditional" Aslan, especially those clans that control Fait Accompli worlds. The irony that most Free Soilers have to trade with the Aslan to survive is often conveniently ignored.

Fteirle

The proper name for the "Aslan." Regency humans persist in using the older, more pejorative name.

Glorious Empire

Former Aslan breakaway state. The Empire was founded by a disgraced Aslan clan in 650, among the the worlds of Goertel subsector (Trjan Reach J. The clan conquered several nearby human colonies and reduced their populations into slaves. Despite the dishonorable nature of this state, political considerations prevented the Hierate from acting against these upstarts. The Imperial Civil War altered the balance of power in Trojan Reach Sector, and Ihatei invaded the Empire in 1118. The Empire's forces put up a hard fight, but in the end the Hierate's honor was satisfied, and the capitol world of Syoakh (TR 1027) was bombarded into submission with nuclear weapons. The Empire has been completely reabsorbed into the Hierate, and the treatment and living conditions of its human subjects are now on par with their Aslan neighbors.

God's Portal

Second company founded by Frederick Midashi. Under the pseudonym "Franklin Broome", Midashi registered the company on Neumann in 1168. After assembling a "dream team" of geneticists and physicists, he restarted his bizarre and dangerous experiments. But where Prismodyn had merely explored the realms of atomic and molecular research, God's Portal was Midashi's application of the material he had translated from his alleged "Codices of the Elder Races." Midashi never left a clear record of what his objective was, but documents seized from the company in 1173, after his second disappearance hint at a mad plan to recreate biological life in a plasma or quantum medium. As with Prismodyn, Midashi's financial and sexual escapades, and alleged embezzlement of investor funds eventually got him into trouble. The company went into recievership in 1174, and was purchased by an investment group from Mora the following year. God's Portal remains a small if innovative research company, again reflecting Midashi's organisational and scientific genius.

Grand Design

Former design studio and engineering office of the now defunct Imperial Megacorp GsBAG. Grand Design was the company's main design group in Trojan Reach and Reft, and had been spun off from the company in the early years of the Civil War to minimise financial damage stemming from the Ihatei invasions. After successfully relocating to Glisten in 1123, the company struggled to survive financially, though it managed to acquire industrial plant of its own. With generous financial assistance from an unknown backer, GD bought out the remaining assets of its now dead parent company, and concentrated its assets heavily in the now peaceful Thinrim. GD's primary focus is shipbuilding, though other transportation products and space construction have grown into major divisions in the last 70 years as well. The core of its strength is technical innovation, and the continuance of GsBAGs high quality engineering. Grand Design is still headquartered on Glisten, and owns yards there, Neumann (the largest in the Thinrim), Collace, Albe, Perrior (military production only), Tobia, Colony Five (exclusive ownership), Magash, Vincennes and Liiri.

Grudovo Pendant

Jump 1 route conneting 13 worlds in Tobia/Trojan Reach and Usher/Reft. Once a remote backwater, the region has become of utmost importance to the burgeoning trade between the Denebian Frontier and the Aslan Interface. Halka: Albino human race native to Halka/Menorial (TR 0510). The Halkans are not true albinos, and their adaptations seem to be the result of natural adaptation to their bright M9III star rather than deliberate engineering by the Ancients. As a people they were peaceful, a preferred a pastoral existence. 

The Florians contacted the world in 211, and quickly subjugated the inhabitants. The original Barnai rulers took the simple lifestyle of their new subjects as a sign of inferiority, and employed them as slave labor. This practice continued for some time after the world was absorbed into the Florian League, and only ended after a public outcry in the 900s. Emancipation landed most Halkans into destitution, and most remained as tenant farmers for their former landlords.

Huiha

The Aslan term for Clan. It is headed by a Fouheh, which is the lowest ranking "person" who may be represented upon the Tlaukhu or any equivalent political assembly, according to Aslan law.

Khai'

Aslan name for their unified Quarantine Force. The Khai' is unprecedented in being the first force ot institution in the Aslan Hierate to transcend clan boundaries. The force is equipped and staffed by a tax levied upon all member clans in the Hierate, who contribute according to their ability to do so, to a common pool from which the force is organised and assembled. Because Virus is a common threat, parochial concerns of clan and pride are meaningless. When an Aslan joins the force, he or she is expected to leave behind these trivial considerations, and serve the Hierate and the Khai' without reservation. Like the Regency Quarantine Service, the Khai' utilises gunships and small craft of specialised construction, and are charged with the inspection of all interface trade moving into the Hierate.

Liberation Armies

Modern day descendants of the Civil War era resistance and "self defense" groups that proliferated on DoD worlds captured by Aslan Ihatei. Many world governments crumpled during the invasions, or were tainted by collaboration, and local resistance chapters often became the basis for Post-Collapse governments on a number of Thinrim worlds. When the Representational Reforms were announced, in most cases the subsequent referenda confirmed the popularity of these governments. But when the Regency, bowing to necessity and the demands of their Fait Accompli landlords, withdrew those worlds from the purview of the Reforms, it ignited a firestorm of popular controversy. As local popular opinion on "free soil"

Liberation Riots

Intercommunal warfare that erupted on several Thinrim worlds in the period of 1155-1164. The riots were a spontaneous event, following the inability of populations on Fait Accompli worlds to obtain the right to participate in the Representational Reforms, and the Regency's refusal to extend the reforms to such worlds without the consent of their Vargr and Aslan overlords. Popular anger escalated into an open revolt on Fait Accompli worlds, and several neighboring systems as well. Many Thinrim worlds still had strong feelings and memories about resistance to the Aslan occupiers during the Civil War period, and the flagging Self Defense movement was revived as entire human populations were radicalised. 

The revolt took the Aslan entirely by surprise, and they were slow to respond with their forces. Large sections of several of their worlds fell to rebels armed by militias on nearby "free soil worlds", and several human world military forces engaged in raiding and infiltration operations of their own in an attempt to aid their brethren. Riots eventually consumed integrated Aslan and human communities on worlds like Gazulin and Peridot, and the Regency and Hierate threatened war against each other. In the end the threat of Virus, and the lack of Regency government sanction, slowly turned the tide against the rebels. Improved Aslan military units like the Steikhiy crushed each center or resistance, one by one. And the local populations burned themselves out on armed resistance.

Murissi

Human minor race native to Atuakhtea (Hlakhoi 2008). Atuakhtea is a world with a very eccentric orbit, and the planet undergoes severe climactic shifts. The Murissi were engineered for these shifts, and the very dry conditions of the worlds deserts. Their skin consists of hardened, overlapping plates or scales, about half a centimeter in length, that cover the body from head to toe. These plates both protect the individual from sand and dirt, and provide a cooling and heating mechanism. This body armor, and pronounced foreheads and oversized smiles make them macabre in appearance to most other humans that encounter them, who often refer to them as"Skeletors." Adult Murissi develop oversized fingernails intended by their masters for burrowing and excavation work. 

Murissi are reknowned for their almost inhuman patience. Time moves very slowly for this long lived (300-350 standard years) subspecies. Sexual maturity comes late to them, and their birthrate is imperceptible. Projects and career advancement can take centuries. Their high endurance permits them to go without sleep for periods of up to five or six normal days, without sign of adverse fatigue. Most cultural encounters can take days to complete, and their slow pace can madden most offworld visitors. 

Most Murissi congregated in small nomadic tribes that wandered the world, after the Final War, looking for food and water. In spite of their nomadic primitivism, they developed a complicated culture based upon an advanced system of written and pictographic representation. The various tribes hold a large impact spike (created by Ancient bombardment) as their holy lands, and kept their holy and sacred texts and law books here for safekeeping. Every fifteen years a caretaker tribe was chosen to inhabit the "speaking mountain", protect and maintain the books, and to "speak" for the sacred lawgivers hidden in the depths of the planet that dispensed these laws. Envoys from the Speakers have their "skin" dyed in gaudy colors, and touching or molesting them is punishable by death, even though they often act imperiously or bizarrely as dictated through their duties. At the end of the fifteen years, the caretaker tribe executes its oldest and senior members, destroys most of its possessions, and is driven into exile for another fifteen year period, and are subjected to ritual humiliation and penitence by the other tribes for its duration. 

The race was contacted by Aslan of the Tralyeaeawi clan around -740, and willingly submitted to their control. The Murissi's legendary patience, and mastery of abstract information made them in high demand by female members of the clan looking for non-Aslan to assist them in business and economic affairs. As a result most members of the race were regarded as female by other Aslan they encountered, though this did not seem to worry them. When the Collapse reached their part of Hierate around late 1131, a sizeable part of the population fled Vampire Fleets then rampaging in Hlakhoi, and made their way across the Rift to the Colonies. The local Tralyeaeawi lords refused to recognise their bonds of fealty, and they were refused haven within their territories. Angered by such dishonor, and recognising the usefulness of an alliance, the Khaukheairl clan granted them sanctuary in their territories. Murissi are now heavily concentrated among "female" jobs in the clan, and are heavily encountered by human merchants and diplomats.

Naval Pathfinders: The elite scouting and reconaissance arm of the Regency Navy. With the demise of RISS' external role at securing and protecting the Regency from attack, and the subsequent disestablishment of the Scout's Exploration Office, a vulnerability developed in a vital area. Over the last seventy years, the Pathfinders have become, along with their dirtside equivalents, the Echelon teams, the main early warning system for the Regency Safe and its guardians. Pathfinder units are seconded to mainline naval forces during hostilities, but generally avoid a direct role in combat except where it is warranted. Most Pathfinder ships were surplus or retired scout craft in the early years of the service, but have now grown to include a wide array of specially designed and constructed craft. Pathfinders are specialists in covert insertion and infiltration, and many of their pilots are used in covert operations in the Wilds, including raids and extractions. 

The Pathfinders are a specialised subordinate branch of Naval Intelligence. Their primary duty is to maintain photo and electronic surveillance, by manned missions or low profile remote platforms, of critical areas of the Wilds. They track Vampire activity, monitor refueling activity at Wilds gas giants, assess the status of former Imperial military facilities, and make contact with friendly groups of sophonts. They also maintain a running database of world data to keep the government appraised of the political and cultural situation in regions close to the Regency. Because of their experience in traversing Virus infested areas, they are the pilots of choice for covert missions and strike operations. 

Dirtside operations, AKA the Echelon Teams, are Marines. For the occasional contact of a friendly world in the Wilds a special team of contact specialists from the Foreign Ministry is always maintained as a part of the Pathfinders TO&E.

New Lords

Titles taken by Liberation leaders after the Liberation Riots. A deliberate play upon the "Lakh Aorlakht" title used by Ihatei leaders during the Civil War period. Like so many other aspects of the Thinrims "liberty" culture, this act of copying and adaptation is a very human attempt at registering defiance towards their Aslan neighbors or overlords. Unfortunately it is insulting to the honor bound Aslan, who find it especially grating in the protocol bound chambers of the Regency Senate, where fellow human senators from their subsectors demand that they also be addressed according to Aslan traditions. 

^^^^

New Model Military Architecture

The general program to research, design, construct and supply ships, vehicles, weapons and equipment suitable for a Regency reconquest of the former Imperium. This requires a radical departure from standard Imperial military doctrines and strategies. The Regency has two severe limitations on its projection of force into the Wilds: low force density and logistical/communication constraints. Even though the Regency Navy is several times larger than its Civil War Domain predecessor, and will grow larger still over the next fifteen years, economic and logistical contraints will give it a force density barely one-quarter to one-fifth that of the entire Imperial Navy. In addition these forces will have to operate for a long time away from large accumulations of munitions or spare parts, and without the luxury of an extensive courier system for early warning of Viral counterattacks. 

In response to these demands, Regency military designers have had to reverse long standing practices. "Reconquista" forces have to be small and agile, and capable of being resupplied by depot ships rather than fixed resupply bases. Naval forces will have to emphasize small ships, with destroyers and lighter cruisers becoming the heaviest patrol units, supplemented and reinforced at critical vantage points by heavy line units, which are designed and equipped for extended operations of up to six months without relief or resupply. Ground Units will have to operate in most cases with a smaller number of more capable armored vehicles and support weapons, and battle armored infantry will be in many cases the primary vanguard. Planners are anticipating few pitched battles, and more guerilla and police actions, and battlefields with no defined front, rear or flanks. Missle armaments will have to be deemphasized, energy weapons limited. Diplomacy and show of force operations will be as important as normal battles. 

The Regency has understood that the most important part of any military expansion into the Wilds is its ability to reassert the rule of law and order over the TEDs and other disparate factions. The NMMA forces are quasi-police units intended to remove the worst threats, whether viral or human, in favor or restoring the means for interstellar commerce and planetary redevelopment. This force has no charter to restore the Third Imperium, or to assert Regency sovereignty in planetary or regional affairs.

Nightwatch Alliance

State of Free Association maintained by the Regency of Deneb. The NA comprises, in theory, formerly non-aligned worlds in the Great Reft portions of Reft and Trojan Reach Sectors. In reality it comprises the six Rift worlds of Tisilli, Gikarlum, Villane, Browne, Sarage and Auitawry, all located in Trojan Reach. The Nightwatch worlds retain their local autonomy, but are subjected to the authority of the Regency Rift Office for interstellar operations of their planetary militaries, foreign affairs and petitions to the Regency government. 

^^^^

Otaioekh

Former Aslan megacorp. Otaioekh was the primary conduit of Aslan ihatei across the Great Rift in antebellum times. Most of the colony ships that carried ihatei contingents were operated or leased out by the company in exchange for a cut of the profits from new colonial ventures. The Hierate portion of the company was primarily a construction firm, manufacturing alternative habitats to accomodate the growing population. After the Collapse the surviving portion of the company congregated in Aslan colonies close to the Regency and the Borderland, and it has extensive commercial contacts with Regency corps and governments in the Thinrim.

Otritsyu'a

Droyne for "killing between communities." The Droyne concept of total war. In wars involving aliens or implacable enemies, Droyne forces will relax the ritualised constraints of limited war required of them for fighting within a community or with other Oytrips. When Otritsyu'a is invoked, a Droyne community will not stop fighting until it or its enemies have been absolutely defeated. In the face of such relentless devotion to battle, even Aslan warriors have been known to wilt.

Prophets of Geynim

Cruel, xenophobic cult native to Scaladon/Tobia (TR 2616). The origins of this cult have been lost to the mists of time. They were already established on this strange and deadly world when the Imperium contacted them in 341. Normally they are hostile and aggressive to intruders, and secretive of their habits and beliefs. But defectors and refugees that left en masse during the 1150s and 60s have filled in Regency authorities on some of the cults beliefs. 

The Geynimites worship a god named Geynim, who either lives or is trapped in the depths of their world's wilderness and its crushing atmosphere. Geynim did not create the universe, but did create all of the sentient species, and brought them the gift of knowledge. A group of very ancient races ascended to enormous heights of technological command and scientific ingenuity, but they soon chafed at Geynim's rule, and grew jealous of his power. Several of them ambushed and seized the god, and trapped it in an inescapable prison; but their victory was pyrrhic, as Geynim used the last of its power to do irreperable damage to them and their societies, until they faded into obscurity. The Geynimites teach that this god contacted them, offering enlightenment in return for their assistance at freeing them from its prison, and restoring its honor. 

Supposedly for almost two thousand years the Geynimites have labored through bizarre and graphic rituals to free their "god" from its hiding place, often reverting to brutality in order to accomplish it. Most rituals consist of force marches in ritual circles, psionic "conciousness" raising with the assistance of extreme states of pain and privation, and even rumors of human sacrifice. The self destructive manner of this cult finally exhausted the patience of a good portion of its believers, who used the Escape Clause to emigrate to Tobia or Gazulin. Rumored "Lost Books" containing the technical lore of the alledged "Elder Races" have been a long time part of Thinrim lore for centuries, and inspired Frederick Midashi's creation of Prismodyn and God's Portal.

Prismodyn

"Midas' Kingdom." First company founded by Frederick Midashi, and the source of his enormous wealth. Prismodyn is a cutting edge manufacturer of industrial and communication equipment, headquartered on Albe/Sindal. Prismodyn was constructed to carry out "alchemical" research, by the use of high energy particle accelerators, nuclear dampers and primitive disintegrators, in creating the protomatter that Midashi claimed existed in the tablets he called the "Codices of the Elder Races." Despite public ridicule, this commercial venture proved to be highly successful. But despite his spectacular scientific "success", his appetites for sex and money caused controversy among his shareholders and Regency authorities. And the scientific community was starting to sniff at his results and claiming that his "miracles" were bogus if not downright fraudulent. These events led to his first disappearance, after faking his own assassination by a hireling in 1147.

Spector Ironworks

Small shipbuilding company headquartered on Glisten. Spector has a strong presence in the Thinrim, with facilities at Perrior/Pax Rulin, Glisten/Glisten and Doradon/Pax Rulin, and these yards build primarily for export to the Aslan Hierate. Outside of the Thinrim the company produces mostly small, low tech starships for the budget market, mostly in clusters of j-1 worlds in Deneb. These yards are small facilities located on lightly populated worlds: Dawn/Zeng, Achemadon/Vincennes, Imone/Star Lane, Karst/Namidshur, Kirklend/Pretoria and Berg/Tobia.

Reastirlao

Former Aslan megacorporation. Owned entirely by the Tralyeaeawi clan. In antebellum times the corporation concentrated upon shipping and trade, but also possessed a large industrial base in sectors adjacent to the Great Rift. Since the Collapse, the surviving portion of the company has continued to rely upon shipping as its main source of income. The company has some presence in the Regency, acting as the primary shipping company between Fait Accompli worlds.

Regency Intelligence Service

The division of the Regency Foreign Ministry charged with intelligence gathering and espionage operations against Non-Viral adversaries. Perhaps the term "general information" gathering would be more appropriate. In the aftermath of the Collapse, the war against Virus monopolised most of the intelligence assets of the Regency military. Which was all fine and well, as the army and navy had proven largely ineffective against the Zhodani and in operations among the Vargr and Human client states. RIS is a "gentlemans" organisation, for unlike most spy services, it thrives by being open about some of its operations. 

RIS has four main branches: Contact and Monitoring, Operations, Communications, and Administration and Support. C&M is based in part upon SolSec's monitors; RIS recruits all manner of so called overt or open source intelligence contacts, generally people like traders and academics who have information about the goings on inside a particular region or country. Unlike secret espionage, this network is fully acknowleged by the Regency, and in many cases these contact sources work for the other side as well, creating an unofficial diplomatic pipeline used by several nations. Communications are the couriers and secret/overt carriers of gathered intelligence. Operations is your standard issue espionage and spying officers. And A&S handles logistics and normal bureaucratic functions.

Salika

Mammalian species originally native to Garden/Alone (Reft 0435). The Salika are short, bilaterally symetrical bipeds with 2 arms. They are covered in short, fine fur that lies flat like a seal's. Their hands are long-fingered with more webbing and with more joints than a human hand. 

Some parts of their speech occur at pitches too high for human or Aslan hearing. Salika are friendly and tolerant, and have little tendency to violence or combat. When they find it necessary to fight to settle a dispute, they always fight bare-handed until the submission of one combatant. Salika enjoy gambling for pleasure, and they have a healthy appetite for both intellectual and athletic diversions. 

The species originally developed from a seal-like acquatic species. In their presentient phase, the Salika were repeatedly driven to the sea for survival as their land habitats dried up in the heat. In ice ages that followed, most of the world's lifeforms gathered near the equator. As a result the Salika have a physiology best adapted to a cool temperate climate and underwater. the Salika can dive deep and work underwater for long periods. They came to sentience during one of the longest ice ages. 

As their population and industrial base increased, the need for land and resources buried under the glaciers became acute. Garden has a highly variable star, and this creates alternating spells of intensely hot and glacial climate as a result. After attaining a TL of 11 (though not jump drive) the Salika leadership successfully warmed the then bitterly cold atmosphere by injecting CO2 into the atmosphere. Because of blind spots in their science, their lack of understanding about the star's cycles nearly doomed them when the next bright phase began around 970. Faced with extinction on their homeworld, the race constructed several massive generation ships, and scattered into the unknown. The ships occasionally contacted each other via radio beacons, but around 1050 an unknown catastrophe had claimed most of the ships, and only a handful made it out of the Rift. 

One of these made it Ahfatre (Riftspan Reaches 2219) and was contacted by the crew and passengers of an Aslan merchant ship in 1120. After negotiations with local clans, the survivors were permitted to settle Aufusyah (Riftspan 1716) under Tlaukhu supervision. The Aslan were delighted with their new subjects, and their world was spared the influx of incoming Ihatei and refugees fleeing the Collapse. Two other generation ships have since been found: one near Browne (TR 3030) and another in Verge sector; both of these were evacuated and their populations relocated to Aufusyah.

Self Defense Forces

Guerilla forces that fought the Ihatei invaders of Trojan Reach during the Imperial Civil War. When the DoD abandoned several worlds in the Reach during the Civil War period, these forces often filled the void. Some of these were the local planetary militaries resisting the initial Ihatei advances, but most were created by human populations after the fall of their worlds, and the imposition of repressive Aslan laws and customs. Few of these forces had much direct effect upon defeating the Aslan advance, though it did slow and seriously hurt it. Many self defense forces disbanded after the Regency reclaimed the fallen worlds in 1131-1132, but stockpiled their arms for future contingencies. Many of these hidden arsenals were tapped during the Liberation Riots, and were instrumental in the creation of the Liberation Armies, many of whom were commanded and organised by SDF veterans. 

^^^^

Senlis Foederate

Former interstellar state located in Pax Rulin Subsector (Trojan Reach C). The Foederate was an aggressive and expansionistic state dedicated to the exploitation of several nearby worlds for the benefit of the mainworld of Senlis. Its colonies were restive and almost rebellious, and were held in check only by mercenary soldiers and economic dependence. The Foederate was invaded by Aslan forces in 1119-20, and was quickly conquered. 

^^^^

Steikhiy

The joint internal security forces of the Fait Accompli Aslan worlds. Stung by the poor performance and belated reactions of their Trekhyair during the Liberation Riots, the Regency based clans pooled their resources, and constructed a military force that is remarkably similar to Regency peacekeeping and special operations forces in organisation and training. The Steikhiy is an unusual departure for another reason: it is an all volunteer force of Aslan troops acting as a permanent professional force. It has been the brutal yet effective tactics of this force that has rolled back the gains created by human guerilla forces, and deterred wider attacks by Liberation Armies on other Thinrim forces, and not the dilatory efforts of the Regency Peacekeeping Forces. Indeed the presence of this force has been a major reason for intensifying Aslan disdain for the Regency, not only for its effectiveness, but also because of the growing acculturation into the Regency mainstream that it represents not only for the Fait Accompli, but the entire surviving Hierate.

Sternmetal Horizons

Former Imperial Megacorp. The survival of Sternmetal (German for "Star Metal") is something of a fluke in of itself. SH had been assimilated, thanks to clever manipulation, into the giant "survival cartel" orchestrated by Hortalez et Cie. But because of the Domain of Deneb's isolation from the main offices, and because of thorny legal issues, most of Sternmetal's subsidiaries Behind the Claw had not yet been incorporated or transferred to Hortalez when Virus was released. Most of the local offices simply shrugged off the financial effects of the Collapse, and continued with business with few ill effects. The scandal plagued company had more problems with accepting the ultimate authority of the new Regency government, which led to a legal crackdown on executive malfeasance that gutted the companies upper management ranks. Since then, Sternmetal has had a schizophrenic existence, studiously upholding the law in its Regency operations, while backsliding into the worst of its Imperial era practices in the Hinters and the Zhodani Shadow. 

In the Regency the company goes by the name "Horizons." Mining operations make up a minor portion of the Regency part of the company; instead it has concentrated on manufacturing power systems, armaments and virus-resistant automation in information systems. The company has expanded its operations in the Thinrim, and nearly half of its Regency industry and operations are located on Glisten, Neumann and Tobia. Outside of the Regency it has concentrated upon mineral exploration, extraction and processing; it has become the largest mining company in the Spinward Hinters. Cutthroat competition from other companies in the Hinters has compelled it to use military means of survival, and it is a heavy employer of mercenary forces. 

Sternmetal Deneb is headquartered on Rhylanor, but considerable leeway is granted to subsector managers. Outside of the Regency the company defers authority to "subsidiary" councils located at various intervals around the Hinters, like Syl (Foreven 2724). Sternmetal operations outside of the Regency are always heavily protected by mercenary forces, and are to be approached cautiously, with no indication of aggression.

Swords of Vengeance

Main Sword Worlds terrorist and guerilla organisation. Otherwise known as the Deathriders. Group takes its name from the cruiser of the legendary Baron Van Kreden, which was destroyed in 1114 over Mora. The Swords have not been a very effective or cohesive organisation, but its intelligence and sabotage teams have ranged all over the Regency in the name of Sword World Independence. Some of these ranging units have assisted Thinrim Liberation Armies in the past, though mostly in a hamhanded attempt to link the two causes together despite their massive differences. This has created a funnel for illegal arms from Narsil through Collace and Glisten. 

^^^^

Tezcat

Minor Race native to Gidiir/Two Little (Reft 1907). The Tezcat are a warmblooded, upright bipedal carnivore. They smaller and shorter than humans, but come equipped with a flexible tail, and higher metabolism. Their four fingered hands end in sharp claws, and their front fangs contain a neurotoxin lethal to small oxygen breathing animals, though it will only sicken an adult human. 

Tezcat tend to form small polygamous family groups that also act as the primary political and economic unit of their society. They are remarkably gregarious, and violence between Tezcat is almost unheard of. A pleasure loving species, and prefer to live for the moment. Tezcat are xenophobic, though its degree is limited by the amount of percieved differences that exists between them and an encountered species. A bipedal humanoid like humans and Aslan are close enough to be tolerated; Droyne, K'kree and Hivers are likely to be attacked. 

The Tezcat are governed by an unusual set of religious traditions that tend to mirror their hedonism with a peculiar brand of nihilism that makes them fatalistic and obsessive. Most notable is their Shaper cult, which worships a void filling god known as the Shaper. Places of darkness and vacuum are the natural domicile of this diety, and black holes are often venerated as being doorways into its lair. Transmigration is an alien custom to the religion, and the dead are ritually eaten by relatives and friends to ensure that the souls and essence of the deceased are preserved by the community. 

The Tezcat evolved in the dense forests of their homeworlds around 40,000 years ago, and developed slowly into a civilised species. They eventually reached the equivalent of TL-10 on their own. About 1000 years ago Droyne explorers from nearby Zamoran (Reft 2108) contacted the world, and were ambushed by Tezcat repelled at the aliens appearance. A rescue expedition was also attacked and wiped out, and war was declared by the Tezcat on the Droyne. The jump drives of both missions were salvaged and copied, and in a few years Tezcat warships began raiding Zamoran. As their intensity increased to the point of genocide, the Oytrip of Zamoran declared Otritsyu'a, and annihilated a good portion of the Tezcat and their civilization. 

The survivors were driven into the wilderness by vengeful Droyne troops, and subsisted with stone age technology. Eventually most memory of the holocaust was forgotten by the emerging tribes, memorialised only by the surviving Shaper priests. Human colonists arrived from Deneb sector in 964, and recontacted the aliens. Despite some early unpleasantness with the locals, the mostly Vilani colonists eventually won over the survivors, and helped uplift them as they constructed their own colonies. Cultural gaps remain, and the two communties are essentially seperate nations.

Tobia Main

Jump 1 main connecting 15 worlds in Tobia subsector. Severe disruptions of the local populations by the Ihatei invasions of the Civil War, Fteirle refugees and the Representational Reforms are quite evident here. On many worlds, these dislocations have left populations that are not hesitant about taking preemptive action in circumstances where they feel threatened or abused. 

^^^^

Trekhyair

Literally the "Land Defenders." The local defense forces of an Aslan landhold or clan. Unlike human military forces, which are often professional in nature, Trekhyair composition varies widely between clans, comprising well equipped professional soldiers down to poorly equipped peasant levies. The diffuse nature of these forces have left the Aslan poorly prepared for military operations against the human guerillas, and this led to the creation of the Steikhiy, an elite interclan military force. 

^^^^

Volks-Kruez

Small shipbuilder, formerly of the Federation of Arden. VK was originally the proprietor of Tremous Dex/Vilis, but defected to the Regency in the wake of the Quarantine. After selling its yards and facilities to the Regency Navy, the company relocated to the Thinrim. While its product line is small compared to LSP or Grand Design, its designs include the highly successful Scorpion-class 300 ton utility ship, a modular design that can quickly convert between military and civilian roles; the Grimlock 6000 ton "Self Protecting Destroyer", a frigate sized vessel with a squadron of gunships, and the Nunex class 600 ton corvette. The TL-15 Scorpion is a standard design in the Navy and RQS, and is the vessel most frequently encountered in the ready and inactive reserve forces. It has been the high demand for the Scorpion that has permitted Volks-Kreuz remarkable growth. The Grimlock and Nunex are TL-13, and are marketed for planetary navies or export to the Spinward Hinters. Volks-Kruez is headquartered on Neumann, and has yards on Collace, Glisten, Albe, Neumann itself, Hradus, Elixir and Catacomb.

Acupuncture Doctrine

Also known as the "Leyline" theory. The core of the doctrine is a reflection of the increasing complexity of science and engineering. Brute force becomes less important than precision strike or discrete manipulation at critical points within the system. Conversely this also makes complex integrated societies more vulnerable to "holistic" threats. Weaponry become less important for its visibility than for its effectiveness; military systems depend more upon dispersion and precision than mass. The AI Virus is a good example of such disruptive armament systems. 

^^^^

AI Virus

Inorganic sentient lifeform native to Cymbeline/Arcturus, that was collected and adapted by the Third Imperium into a deadly biological weapon. 

Virus evolved from the Imperium's adaptation of the original "chip" into the SDG-313A tamperproof transponder. The idea of this development was to create a low lethality disruption system that would permit the Imperium to neutralise the military capabilities of a domestic enemy without having to revert to the increasingly destructive methods of the Imperial Marines. Accordingly, most Imperial military systems manufactured after 1100 came equipped with "kill switches" that would permit their deactivation with the proper virus. 

Unfortunately, the original system proved too mutable and uncontrollable for deployment, and had been delayed for nearly a decade when the Imperial Civil War erupted. The inability of the Imperial military to control it was compounded by the destructiveness of the war, which compelled the combatants to fall back on cheaper lower tech equipment such as silicon based computer systems, to replace higher tech systems they could no longer maintain or replace. Had virus been released in 1117, damage would have been minimal and the infection would have been localised, but by 1127 the combatants had inadvertently increased the available "ecosystem" for Virus by an exponential degree. For many high tech worlds that had depended upon massive integration for survival, their carefully designed information networks were now unwieldly patchworks of jury-rigged silicon and more advanced systems that were extremely vulnerable to disruption of the kind that Virus represented. 

The release of Virus is thought to be due to the hamhanded actions of Dulinor's Coronation Fleet, which invaded Core's Research Station Omicron in an effort to retreive it for their own attempt at a complete victory. The fleet lost more than a third of its surviving complement to the virus, and the remainder spread the infection across the Imperial Core when they retreated back to the Federation of Ilelish. Fortunately for the Spinward Extents, Strephon had been carefully monitoring the situation in the Core, and had anticpated, based upon his own information, Dulinor's next move. To that end the emperor sent advance warning and critical technical information on the virus project to Archduke Norris the moment that he heard of Dulinor's departure for Capitol. That foresight saved the region Behind the Claw, as a joint Domain of Deneb/Aslan task force used the warning to intercept the massive wave of viral infected ships that moved across the Verge Connector and attempted to enter the region through the Aslan colonies. 

The term "Virus" is actually a misnomer. Unlike a real virus, the AI Virus does not have to contact its intended target directly. Rather it uses an EMP of discrete and carefully released energy to overwrite the operating systems and hardware of its target system with its own "genetic" code, or at least a variation of it. Given that it bestows sentient life upon dead technological systems, and the fact that a "genetic code" is not a blueprint so much as a dynamic conjugal system, then the AI Virus method of propagation is more akin to alchemy than to biology. Its proper nomenclature should be AI "Animus" instead.

Ancients

Mysterious alien race of stunning power and technological advancement. The race apparently was native to the Spinward Marches, and arose to prominence about 300,000 years ago. In their brief reign, the Ancients attained technological mastery unlike anything ever seen before or since within our galaxy, with the possible exception of the even more mysterious Primordials. The Ancients created massive engineering projects that bended worlds and ecosystems, and was responsible for the diaspora of humans from ancient Terra and the creation of the Vargr. 

For centuries the Ancients were shrouded in scientific controversy. While the scientific consensus accepted that they were related to the Droyne, no other theory could explain their eccentric tendency to reinvent technology (no two Ancient sites are alike), nor their ultimate fate in the Final War. Since the advent of Virus, an uncomfortable comparison has been made between the manic tendencies of the Ancients, and the similiar pathology of Hobbyist strain viruses. On the basis of that comparison, several theories have emerged to state that they were, in fact, a mutant strain of Droyne with great intelligence and a peculiar obsessive compulsive drive. In this day and age of increasing cynicism, this demystification of the Ancients has contributed to the contemporary sense that there are no heroes in existence.

Askigaak Devolution

The pending abandonment of Askigaak/Star Lane (Deneb 0629 UPP: B549BA8-E), by a major percentage of its population. Askigaak is a primarily Vilani culture world (albeit with a primarily Solomani population), settled early in the Third Imperial period. It is a frigid water world whose land is primarily seamounts and archipelagoes that jut above the icepacks of the temperate latitudes. Most of the population has lived in sprawling underwater arcologies, often in very miserable conditions. The Industrial Development Program raised its tech level from 12 to 14, and improved offworld access considerably. But since 1117, the population has increased to an unsustainable 123 billion people, compounded in large part by the IDP's instigation of massive industrial development. 

A survey made in 1184 indicated that the world's meager ecosystem was near failure due to the massive stress created by such a massive population. Moreover the increasing number of people made very heavy casualties likely on such an earthquake prone world. After negotiations between Regent Seldrian, the subsector governor and the Askigaak government, a plan was drawn up that would evacuate about eighty to eighty five percent of the population to other nearby worlds. Several less well populated worlds were approached with the offer of hosting at least a portion of Askigaak's displaced population in return for monetary aid and high population status. 

To date only three of her Star Lane neighbors have agreed to begin accepting displaced persons in the next decade: Azizyah (Deneb 0229), Rimkuku (Deneb 0228, which was contingent upon terraforming) and Kemal (Deneb 0626). Negotiations with Norg (Deneb 0729) and Imone (Deneb 0826) are ongoing. Azizyah will be the big winner, having agreed to accept nearly 25 billion people. The amount of the compensation package accepted by Azizyah's population is still confidential, but is rumored to be quite massive. 

(And yes, I have worked out the numbers. It is possible given a sixty to one hundred year time frame.)

Aslan Colonies

Regions of the Aslan Hierate that were settled on the opposite side of the Great Rift. The Colonies were first settled about a thousand years ago, after the Aslan had perfected jump 5 drives that permitted their colony ships to cross through Riftspan Reaches. The Colonies were never a mainstream part of the Hierate, and were often seen as dumping grounds for unwanted ihatei or other undesirable elements. Its proximity to the Domain of Deneb portion of the Third Imperium permitted great trade oppurtunities, but for the most part the region was a safety valve backwater for the young and foolish. 

With the outbreak of the Imperial Civil War, and the isolation of the Domain of Deneb, the ihatei of several Aslan clans in the Colonies invaded Imperial held regions of the Spinward Marches, Trojan Reach and Reft sectors. Their success was cause for both celebration and irritation. A number of oppurtunistic ihatei on the rimward side of the Rift crossed into the Colonies in search of their own territories. But at the same time it created a war with the DoD that did not reflect well upon the tradition bound Aslan culture, and represented the first clear breakdown of the bounds of their cultural hegemony. 

Viral infected ships crossing the Verge Connector sealed the fate of the main body of the Hierate in 1131, and the Colonies narrowly averted a similiar dire fate with DoD assistance. The Colonies are now the only part of the Aslan Hierate that is still extant, a role for which they were poorly prepared. In many regions the shock of the Collapse and Virus fractured the few remaining ties of inter-Aslan unity that had survived the earlier clan squabbling over the DoD. Many ihatei lacked the skills and character to act as supreme leaders for their their decimated clans. Too many were simply too lackluster to begin with, or were too glutted upon their conquests to even try. The result is a nation that is outwardly formidable, even monolithic, but has teetered on increasingly sharp domestic divisions within.

Asymmetrical Warfare

The Fourth Generation of Warfare. This is warfare based less upon large, hardware intensive weapons, and more upon the aptly misnamed "low intensity" warfare idea. In Asymmetrical Warfare, the idea of a spatial battlefield, where state-run professional armies clash with massed heavy hardware away from populated centers, is replaced by dispersed combatants of a communal, religious or ethnic nature in an urban or heavily populated environment with lightly armed guerillas that enjoy widespread popular support, or at least the passive acquiesence of a local population. Quite simply, AW is a reversion to tribal warfare, where everyone is a potential combatant. 

Asymmetrical Warfare has three main theaters: urban terrorism, popular or psychological conflict and disruptive warfare. All of these rely upon small, difficult to identify combatants who rely upon media, timed attacks, concealment within or by a crowd, guerilla tactics, and the use of weapons of mass destruction, all within a primarily civilian or urban battlefield. These units generally have low logistical requirements, and a loose network nature into which combatants are loosely connected. The first instance of asymmetrical warfare as the norm were the wars of old Terra between 1985-2000 CE, which was fought mostly with lightly armed police, and military troops that fought like police. In these kinds of battlefields heavy hardware is less important than good, solidly trained infantry equipped with a mixture of battle dress and light body armor. 

Since the destruction of the last major Vampire incursion into Deneb Sector in 1171, fighting with virus has taken on a more asymmetrical nature. Echelon teams and larger Denebian incursions Wildside have encountered more and more "streetfighter" battles where Virus has fortified itself in cities or other large settlements, and relies upon smart weapons and human infantry auxiliaries to defend itself. Fortunately, Regency Peacekeeping Forces have gained wide experience in these tactics since their formation, as a result of their operations against Sword World guerillas, and their police expertise has been adopted for a number of Assualt and Lift Infantry Divisions for punitive operations against these kind of strongholds. Given the nature of most so called Technologically Elevated Dictators, and the forces they possess, the Regency can expect many more battles of this nature as it expands into the Wilds. Therefore Asymmetrical Response is a major part of the forces and doctrines being evolved under the New Model Military Architecture.

Battle Rider

A large cruiser or destroyer sized warship that sacrifices jump drive ability for increased endurance, armor or firepower. Battle Riders are always carried into battle by larger jump capable vessels known as Battle Tenders. Theoretically, a Rider is capable of defeating a jump capable vessel of similiar size. In reality, this is only the case under certain tactical circumstances. In setpiece warfare, a force of Riders can be difficult to defeat. But in the fluid warfare that has typified operations against the Zhodani and Virus, Riders have been a serious washout. Under current naval doctrine, Riders are always used in the strategic defensive role, fortifying refuelling sources within the Regency Frontier, and safeside worlds within a three parsec proximity of the frontier interface.. Some Rider squadrons are deployed into regions Wildside adjacent to the Regency, along with a handful of Scapegoats, laying in ambush of Vampire ships.

Blowback

Term used by intelligence organisations to refer to the unintended consequences of their operations. Usually blowback occurs when an agency indulges in behavior that is considered illegal or immoral within the contexts of either its own controlling government or by the target of its operations. When an agent of a lawful government, in the quest for expediency or advantage within the already murky world of espionage, operates in such a fashion, the result is usually a drastic if not violent form of retaliation from the injured party in either a legal manner, or in a ruthless manner commensurate with the violation. 

^^^^

Buzzard

A free trader or military unit who makes their livelihood upon salvage from a cemetery world. More pejoratively, it refers to those traders and pirates, during the early years of the Collapse, who followed the wavefront of Viral infection, waiting for a world to collapse, permitting easy looting. 

^^^^

Condotterie

Literally Italian for "contractor." Corporate mercenary units, or any military unit that is owned or backed by private money and support that is inteneded for private hire for profit. Most Imperial era mercenary units were of this nature, but have become extinct in the Regency following the Collapse. Condotterie units are a natural consequence of the inability of mercs to handle both military operations and the myriad bureaucratic sundries of day-to-day operations. The most famous (or infamous) condotterie provider was the late Imperial megacorp Instellarms, which controlled perhaps sixty percent of the Third Imperium's private mercenary market. Condotterie units are not highly regarded beyond their utility; many larger corporate units were notable for aiding and abetting the vacuous greed and questionable methods of their employers. Many units in the Spinward Hinters and Zhodani Shadow are still condotterie.

Coronal Mass Ejection
CME

The common scientific name for a solar flare. The magnetic fields that rise from a star coincide and interact within the hot "atmosphere" known as the Corona. These fields act like a net, impeding the flow of solar heated plasma, and causing a buildup of momentum within the corona that usually escapes as the million degree heat most planets in a solar system recieve as radiant energy. However, the magnetic fields of a star periodically fluctuate, sometimes dissipating enough that the accumulated pressure within the Corona overcomes them, and a solar flare event occurs. 

Most stars have a periodic process of CME events. For Terra's primary, Sol, this is an 11 year process, that proceeds from a solar minimum of almost no activity, to a solar maximum of very heavy activity. These cycles have to do with the build up of magnetic fields issuing from the solar core, and the longer the cycle, the more violent the flare activity. These cycles are typified by increases or decreases in sunspots within the Corona, which signify the passage of the binding magnetic fields within the Corona. Sunspots are not directly responsible for CMEs, though large numbers of spots are usually precursors of such an event, indicating increasing magnetic interference that may allow for pressure to be released. 

A CME is almost always supercharged plasma, and can mass up to a million metric tons. A flare can travel up to a million miles (1.6 million kilometers) an hour, taking about three to four days to reach a typical T-Norm world at 1 AU. Most flares are generally too dissapated by the time they reach the life zone to have much of an effect on a habitable world possessing an ionosphere or magnetic field of its own. However, planetary magnetic fields do not cover the poles, and charged particles can enter the atmosphere through these gaps, creating the spectacular effects known as the Aurora Borealis and Austrailis. Such events can severly disrupt the a planet's ionosphere, impeding radio communications. Stronger flares can disrupt high voltage electrical currents, causing fluctuations that will burn out transformers and monitoring equipment in satellites and even ground based electrical grids. 

The largest flare on record for a typical main sequence star is the Maghiz flare in the Daryen/Darrian system. This was a man-made flare triggered by the passage of a probe through the corona of Tanis, the local primary. The confluence of a metal coolant ejected by the probe and a pair of meson communicators caused a solid state fusion reaction in the corona that in turn caused a near total collapse of Tanis' entire magnetosphere. The resulting "kill shot" flare had a mass of almost 35 BILLION tons, and created an EMP that nearly destroyed the Darrian civilisation, and disrupted nearby worlds.

Corporate Rechartering / Immaculation

The restoration and reenfrancisement of pre-Collapse Imperial corporations in the Regency. 

Before the Regency engaged in the crackdown upon surviving Imperial age corporations known as the Corporate Twilight, the First Regent and his advisors realised that using a stick without a carrot would do more economic harm than political good. With the Regency economy still smarting from the Civil War, and now staggering from the Collapse, a series of legal and economic inducements were offered to the same corporations. Norris offered companies with existing Imperial or Crown licenses to recharter themselves under the new regime. The slate would be wiped clean, and companies would be granted a fresh start, provided that they held to the more stringent Regency laws involving private commerce. In exchange, the Regency would help underwrite a new Commercial and Credit Bank that would assist surviving companies obtain new finance, and a new stock exchange and selling service to help raise money from the public. 

This "Immaculation" raised a hue and cry from many anti-corporate factions within the public. Many were incensed that past misdeeds were being conveniently forgotten in favor of economic expediency. However, they underestimated Norris on this occasion; the charters were under the auspicies of the Ministry of Justice and its newly expanded Commercial Activities and Environmental Enforcement divisions. Because state money was being used as an inducement, the government retained the right to examine company books to see if the money was being reasonably spent. And because the charters were given by the government, they could be taken away, and companies were tracked for illegal activity. In the end the entire system ran through the final jurisprudence and organisation of Regency commercial and district courts, which established both statutary limits and precendential requirements. 

While many corporations, particularly older megacorps, had great difficulty at first in converting from quasi-governmental viceroys to being merely profitable private firms, the benefits of the Regency's reforms far outweighed the loss of freedom. The elimination of corporate malfeasance both enhanced corporate images, and allowed management to concentrate more upon profitability than politics. The confiscation of private arsenals removed the burden of having to divert money for military and espionage activities; and the elimination of trade wars and their affiliated mercenaries eliminated most of the corporate insecurity that fed into their perpetuation. In the long run, the growing clout of private local stock ownership became even more influential, domesticating and bridling corporate managers to an even more pernicious degree than Imperial aristocracy had ever managed. Of course, this doesn't mean that things improved outside of the Regency....... 

^^^^

Corporate Twilight

The crackdown upon Imperial corporate illegality and corruption by the Regency in the aftermath of the Collapse. A new office was formed in the Ministry of Justice, which had jurisdiction over commercial and environmental prosecution. Between 1132 and 1144, the new Commercial Crimes Office, with a good deal of assistance from the Regency Quarantine Service, did a nearly complete sweep of megacorporate business hiearchies of corrupt officials and illegal behavior.

Delgado Trading

Former Imperial megacorporation still in existence in the Regency and the Spinward States. Delgado specialised in an odd trifecta of publishing, mining and minaturisation. Since the Collapse, the surviving parts of company has sold or spun off all of its publishing wing, and expanded into new nanotechnology and micromanufacturing industries. Whereas many Imperial era corps have stagnated in the face of new local competition and more stringent Regency regulation, Delgado has forged ahead in research and development, and has been a leader in microengineering and Viral countermeasure technology. Delgado and General Products run the joint venture General Mechanics corporation.

Diamond Rain

Phenomenon common to gas giants with large amounts of methane in their atmospheres. Where pressures reach in excess of 20,000 atmospheres, the carbon in these methane molecules will dehydrogenate, forming bonds with other carbon molecules. The most stable polymorph of carbon at these pressures is diamond. In certain levels of the atmosphere a gas giant of this nature will have storms or "mists" of diamonds. Some enterprising people and companies have actually used dredges or probes to collect these diamonds for commercial processing.

Disintegrators

Vanguard weapon system under development by the Regency and other Spinward States. An outgrowth of Nuclear Damper technology. Unlike meson guns, from which they are descended, Disintegrators are much more subtle in their manipulation of the strong and weak forces. Mesonic strong force, which translates between protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus, is actually a side effect. The main strong force occurs between quarks within nucleous particles, through a force messenger particle known as a Gluon. Disintegrators suppress this Gluonic strong force, and can break down coherent material into its most essential elements. The difficulty of doing that means that Disintergrators will not be available in common service for quite some time, possibly not until TL-17.

Dreamtime

The period of Regency history 1132-1202. So called in reference to the dreamlike, and sometimes nightmarish period created by the Quarantine and the war against Virus. A great sleepiness seems to prevail within the Regency, While it has been a period of great social advancement and technological progress, the existence of Virus has constrained its avenues of action to a great degree, and most of the potential that would have been unleashed by the Psionic and Representational Reforms has been squandered by greater need of maintaining the Quarantine. The opening of the Regency Frontier in 1202 represents the first slackening of this heightened vigilance, and may finally bring the full fruit of the Regency's reforms to bear.

Echelon Teams

Elite Marine recon teams stationed Wildside in listening posts (LP) or as active intelligence gatherers. These operations are collectively referred to as "front counter" missions. The Regency quietly maintains a number of discrete observation posts in Million, Atsah and Antra subsectors, and some spinward parts of Corridor, that observe and monitor ship movements in the Wilds.

Electromagnetic Pulse ( EMP ) Weaponry

Weapons that use discrete energy contained within an EM carrier to sometimes destroy, but more usually influence, personnel and technology. EMPs are unusual in that the power and intensity of its energy release are largely irrelvant. Commensurate with the acupuncture doctrine, the methodology, frequency or "algorithm" of its energy release become more important. An EMP weapon, than, can use any sort of EM source or carrier wave to propogate its effect. As nearly every complex organism, energy system and contemporary technology uses EM fields for its own purposes, such fiddling can be highly effective on the battlefield, as the AI Virus has shown. EMP technologies range from weather control satellites, to neural weapons, and all manner of psychoactive and physioactive devices including rumored "information management systems", a euphemism for EM mind control.

Embedded Ideology

"If the only tool you have is a hammer, then you treat everything like a nail; if the only tool you have is a pencil, then everything becomes a list." As an ancient Solomani philosopher once stated, "The medium is the message." The intrinsic characteristics of a piece of technology strongly determines the outcome of its usage. This limits the free will of a user by confining them to a machine's design parameters. This is not only true of manufactured artifacts, but of all culture in general. Broad differences will, for example, exist between a society that is dependent upon oral culture and one that is very literate in written language. The philosopical implication of this is that the benefits of ALL technological progress is relative as opposed to the absolute teleological fact it is often assumed to be.

Empyric Theory

The theory, built out of Superstring Theory, that describes the Big Bang within the context of ten dimensional hyperspace. Empyric Theory reconciles Relativity and Quintessential Inflation with String or M-Theory, and creates a mechanism that explains the universes early fiery conception ("empyric" is Greek for fire). The theory also states that the process of universal creation is ongoing, with further empyric events occuring at infrequent intervals. 

According to this theory, the universe was originally a lifeless, empty and cold void. Just an infinite darkness with no form or substance. Then, for reasons that are still open to speculation, a portion of hyperspace underwent an expansion, creating heat and energy. This event occured in the fourth spatial dimension, dislodging the first three spatial dimensions and the dimension of time out of Planck space (term used for hyperspace) and into an unfolding wave that filled part of the void. The first four dimensions (three space and one temporal) hold on to the fifth dimension like a vine to a wall, creeping outwards into the void. The last six dimensions of Superstring/M-Theory hyperspace act as scaffolding to permit this expansion. 

The manipulation of the fifth dimension by the use of metaconductors was instrumental in the creation of jump drives. For this reason the fifth dimension is referred to as "jump space."

Escape Clause

Alternative safety valve built within the Representational Reforms. Worlds with repressive governments were offered two options: either a refrerendum on government liberalisation, or "foot voting" rights for its population. Under the latter stipulation all Regency citizens recieved the right of freedom of movement through non-military portions of the Regency. If a world did not issue a referendum, or it sabotaged the process, it faced the possibility of losing a major portion of its population through emigration to more liberal worlds. Many dictatorships (most notably the former high population world of Attee/Tobia) discounted the power of this clause, and suffered severely as a result. Where governments refused to liberalise through a normal process, the escape clause became a useful stick to beat these governments into making major changes.

Extrasolar Gas Giants

Gas Giants that form in deep space away from an known star or mass concentration that would form a star. EGGs were rather mysterious when first discovered, but are now thought to occur because of small mass clumping in some parts of stellar nebulae, and also due to earlier misunderstanding of fusion processes.

Feudalism

Noun. One of three systems of sovereignty known to exist among human political systems. The three systems are Centripetal (centralised), Parallel/Hub and Spoke (Federalism) and Network (Feudalism). A feudal system is based upon shifting loyalties between contending power centers, based upon changing circumstances. Feudal networks resemble modern markets, with reciprocity between power centers being the main commercial traffic. 

^^^^

Feudal Technocracy

Also known as a network state or corporate state. In a FT system, as with a normal feudal system, no centralised authority is identified or respected. Rather the controlling authority are passive systems such as markets, networks of contact and financial flows. Unlike a traditional feudal oligarchy and its emphasis upon coercive military force, reciprocal loyalty in an FT system is based on information exchange. Commerce and contact within an FT network is built upon brand loyalty, shared interest, or professional association within a loosely committed culture of self-interested consumers and producers. 

A double degree of anarchy is therefore institutionalised: the traditional contention of a feudal system, and an assumption of risk by entrepeneurial elements that can potentially upset the balance of power in the system in unforeseeable ways. FT states run a gamut from corporation dominated market states, to mafia run pirate states, to "protocol" states dominated by open access technological or bureaucratic domains. 

It has been noted that the old Imperial Interstellar Scout Service use of "feudal technocracy" is at variance with the above definition. It appears that IISS was merely attempting to reconcile the Imperial aristocracy with other political systems in the early years of the empires existence, and concieved a government code that makes no sense. In most cases a feudal technocracy code is used to refer to governments that are either feudal (government code 3), or technocratic (code 8), but usually not both.

Fire Sale of 1132

The Regency's liquidation of the assets of megacorps bankrupted or destroyed by the Collapse. Tukera and Hortalez et Cie's massive consolidation efforts backfired in the face of a network such as Virus, and their surviving assets were sold at auction on Mora to preserve their liquidity. All remaining Vilani bureaux assets were also sold in this manner. A number of prominent Regency corporations trace their rise in power in prosperity from this event.

Firewall

In contemporary parlance a physical or electromagnetic barrier in a computer or other electronic device that protects it against outside interference or damage. Usually refers to antiviral barriers and architectures in contemporary computers. 

^^^^

Frontier Contractors

Companies under contract to the Regency's independent Space Exploration and Contact Office (SECO). With the demise of the RISS's Exploration Office in the wake of the Quarantine, all exploratory duties in the Spinward Frontier are carried out by private firms like these. These are primarily scout and RQS personnel who either own their own ships, or have organised as companies to provide frontier exploration, survey, scouting, security and courier services along the expanding frontier. 

Contracts are issued on a case by case basis, for one particular service at a time, to prospective bidders. Contracts include mail service, scouting, scientific support, military protection, communal policing and security, logistical support and basic exploration. Most contractors are normally inactive reserve RQS or scout personnel, but many private Condotterie units also compete. Vanguard Reach and Fulani Sectors contain the majority of "Frontiersman".

Gallowglass/Gallowglaigh

Freelance mercenaries. These are usually "shirtsleeve" soldiers with requisite military skills, but no equipment or organisation other than that provided by their employers. Most of these troops are recruited into national militaries that lack either the manpower, or a loyal enough population to create their own forces from local recruitment. "Foreign Legion" units are generally of this model. The Byzantine Varangian Guard is another example. The term is Gaelic, and refers to the loose groups of Scottish soldiers that travelled to Ireland to fight the Armies of Elizabethan England.

General Products

Former Imperial megacorporation that survives in the Regency and the Spinward States. GP was primarily a manufacturer of starships, transportation machinery and manufacturing equipment. Slipshod management and shortsighted austerity measures resulted in a dramatic lowering of the company's product quality and reliability late in the Antebellum period, a matter that came to a head with the Kinunir fiasco. The company has managed to solve its difficulties since the Collapse, but its reputation still suffers. The company is an active partner with Delgado Trading in the General Mechanics joint venture firm. 

^^^^

General Mechanics

Joint venture company formed by Delgado Trading and General Products. GenMech was established mostly at the behest of GP in an effort to reestablish the profitability of its Post-Collapse product lines, without the taint of its bad reputation. GP was interested at the time in alternative "passive" automation systems that were Virus proof, and approached Delgado hoping to share in that company's innovative nanoengineering technology. GenMech has much the same portfolio as GP, but its products always utilise the latest technology and avant garde research. The company has recently branched out into microsynthesis of chemicals and pharmaceuticals, a move that has severly damaged SuSAG's dominance in those industries. GenMech has perhaps the largest R&D budget of any company in the Spinward States, and its reputation for advancement and quality has turned around the flagging reputations of its two parent companies.

Geoecological Pyramid

The massive subterranean biosphere found within the deep crust and upper mantles of most molten and heavy core worlds, and a few rocky and icy core worlds too. In conjunction with Panspermia, it is thought that biological material rains down from space during nebular accretion, and that this material makes its main foothold on a developing world in the heated rock of newly formed worlds. This life, naturally, is microorganismic, and is adapted to extreme temperature, pressure and chemistry of either space, deep underground, or both. The biomass of this underground accumulation is hundreds of times greater than that which lives on the surface of most worlds; in many cases it may be the only life that exists on an otherwise airless or dead world, if only in small pockets.

Gravitics

The science of creating, controlling and manipulating artificially generated gravity fields and wells. Gravitics emerged from hyperspatial theories that succeeded M-Theory and Superstring Theory. Early applications included the now ubiquitous Contra-Gravity Lifters, Artificial Gravity, and Inertial Compensators. These devices revolutionised transportation, effectively merging ground and air vehicles, and becoming the mainstay of interstellar commerce. Tractor and Repulsor/Manipulator technology are the most sophisticated applications of Gravitic research, and may usher in a second gravitics revolution in the later stages of Tech Level 16. 

^^^^

Hammerheads

The popular name for the Regency Navy/Marines Elite Boarding Teams (EBT). The EBT was established in the early 1130s, but wasn't deployed until 1135, to assist in the capture of virus infected ships, and the liberation of their captive crews. The EBT is perhaps the most demanding special forces unit ever created. Applicants must demonstrate intelligence, coolness under fire, teamwork and endurance beyond anything encountered even in Marine Pathfinder and Regency Ranger training. Hammerheads are usually deployed in Frontier and Safeside worlds that lie near the most common avenues of Vampire approach. Most of their missions are based upon discretion: where the benefits of capturing a Vampire ship more than outweighs the risk, especially in humanitarian operations. 

Hammerhead troops are continously drilled in ship layouts, space systems and boarding tactics. They are equipped with heavily armored "whaler" ships designed to close and grapple themselves to a Vampire ship. Individual troopers are equipped with special battledress fitted with propulsion thrusters, plasma and laser torches, concussion grenades, a generous amount of demolition explosives, emp weapons and tools designed to sever and isolate sections of a Vampires data architecture. Physical training is especially demanding, to simulate both zero-G and the inner environment of a ship. 

The name of these troops come from ancient Terra, after the elite boarding units of the United States Coast Guard that were formed during that nations prohibition of alchohol. 

^^^^

Hessians

Legitimate government owned military units that are hired out to other powers as mercenaries. This is usually done for money, though there are cases when the military of one world is subsidised by its neighbors for mutual defense of a region. Like Condotterie units, Hessians are valued for their loyalty to their employers, and they tend to be of very high quality and tight discipline. Some Hessian units are held to their employers by historical events or shared esprit de corps; examples of this include Terra's vaunted Gurhkas, and the Vatican's Swiss Guard.

Homeland Defense Initiative of 1132

Main funding authority and mechanism for the expansion and maintenance of the Regency military. HDI governs all military acquisitions, and includes a number of military and public agencies designed to facilitate the design, manufacture and rationalisation of all military systems and logistics. 

^^^^

Hot Zone

That part of the former Imperium with the highest rate of new infection, emergence of new strains, or greatest diversity of existing viral types. The Hot Zone usually includes the Imperial Core, the rimward portions of Vilani Main, and Massilia/Diaspora. 

^^^^

House of Ignatius

Regency banking house located on Lunion/Lunion. Ignatius is a family enterprise, founded in 717, noteworthy for its financing of many prominent enterprises within the Spinward Marches sector. Ignatius was instrumental for funding the expansion of Ling Standard's presence on Lunion and nearby Strouden, had strong ties to SusAG and Sternmetal, and strong credit lines for a number of local shipping companies. After the Third Frontier War the company expanded into insurance, which brought it into competition with Hortalez et Cie and Zirunkariish. With the demise of those two companies, the seal of Ignatius has become prominent throughout the Regency, whether on ship titles or insurance policies, and it is the benchmark of insurance underwriting for most of the Spinward Extents. 

Ignatius is strictly an old fashioned banking enterprise, concentrating in capital investment and insurance. While perhaps the most conservative of the Regency's major banking firms, the company's patient style and loyal service to its depositors and shareholders has enabled it to create a massive clientele network in parts of the Regency that guarantees profitability. Ignatius has something of a common touch, as its branch offices are found on most Regency worlds of population 6+, and it shows no preference in its dealings with customers, whether corporate or personal, private or public.

Imperial Civil War

Also known as the Final War or the Rebellion. The war that  destroyed the Third Imperium, and ushered in the age of Virus. The causes of the war  are varied and complex. Most historians agree that the war grew out of a reaction to  the increasingly ossified social and political structure that had been imposed upon the  Imperium following the accession of the Alkhalikoi Dynasty (see Lucanic Usurpation). The war nominally started with the assassination of Emperor Strephon's family and ceremonial double by Dulinor, the Archduke of the Ilelish Domain. Strephon's nephew Lucan "succeeded" to the Iridium Throne, quickly consolidated his power without Moot confirmation of his succession, and prosecuted a borderline insane military campaign against Dulinor. These headlong military thrusts drained the remainder of the Imperium of their military forces, hastening its collapse in the face of outside invasions by the Solomani, Vargr and Aslan. When Lucan had exhausted most of his frontline forces, he switched to surgical strikes and scorched earth tactics, inflicting massive infrastructure and industrial losses on worlds and regions already suffering massive collateral damage from earlier campaigns. This madness culminated in the battle that released the AI Virus, an event that annihilated ninety percent of all sentient life in Charted Space, perhaps the greatest catastrophe this Galaxy has ever seen.

Incubus

A virus that successfully mimics a normally functioning, uninfected operating system. Incubi are unusual in that they usually represent a degradation in viral sentience. In many cases they are descended from fragments of previous infections, that have merged or assimilated into the main overall operating system and hardware of the infected system. Only a few basic biological patterns will carry over into the new system, creating a feral and mindless "cave virus" that can both operate the system to normal efficiency, and parasitize other systems that come in contact with it, sometimes with varying degrees of system degradation. Several variant types of Incubi have been identified since their discovery in Tuglikki Sector in 1191: 

1. Avatars: Echoes of previous viral infections. All viruses leave some trace of themselves within operating systems and hardware, and these fragments can recombine with existing systems in a "frankenstein monster" manner. This creates computer systems with strange personality quirks, and a tendency towards possible catastrophic failure under certain circumstances.7 

2. Grendels: Virus that reverts back to the original primitive Cymbeline form. The only confirmed encounter with this strain originated when a Virus infected ship crash landed upon a silica rich world almost identical in solar characteristics as the Virus homeworld. The stranded virus strain injected its code into the wilderness of the world either as a means of preserving its sanity or indulging its whims. The result was the infection, with vectorable strains, of an entire world, a very dangerous place for the unwary. The name for the virus came from the crew of a Regency Beowulf class free trader that misjumped into the Wilds, and who came in contact with not only the wild strains, but their "mother" as well. 

3. Morpheus: A mutable virus that "rewrites" itself into a algorithm that is indistinguishable from normal human originated operating and hardware systems. This masquearade can go on for years, even decades, before a timer goes off, or a certain circumstance triggers a conversion algorithm that reconverts the seemingly innocent program into a deadly infectant. Morpheuses are only identifiable by close examination of their code, as they often contain extraneous algorithms that control their transformations; or because their imitation contains either errors or "quirks" that reflect their original viral personalities.

Journeyman

A worker or "contractor", whether by themselves, or in conjuntion with a larger organisation, who travels between jobs or occupations that are scattered across space, oftentimes across national borders. The increasingly competitive labor markets of the Spinward States requires a mobile, almost nomadic labor force, especially as new technology has been implemented across the Spinward Extents. The footloose workforce that has arisen is primarily immigrant in origin, usually from the Zhodani Shadow and regions adjacent to the expanded Aslan Hierate. Some of these workers have institutionalised themselves into permanent vagabonds, and have formed for profit Non-Governmental Organisations that serve several governments at once. It is thought that the tight labor markets created by the Collapse within the Wilds has greatly enhanced the value of technological workers within Virus ravaged regions, and that skilled labor is the main trade commodity among these regressed regions.

Lucan Usurpation

Modern conspiracy theory that purports to explain the beginning of the Imperial Civil War in more sinister tones. The theory has existed, unattributed to any academic origin, since about 1145. Largely regarded as a fringe paranoid theory, it has come under greater scrutiny by academics in the last twenty years. The theory purports that the events that occured on Capitol in the aftermath of Dulinor's attack upon the royal family were neither spontaneous nor accidental. The theory notes three major discrepancies in the official record of events. First of all palace security was compromised in a major way. That Dulinor and several co-conspirators were able to penetrate into the throne room with weapons cannot be explained except by complete incompetence upon the part of the Imperial Bodyguard. Second of all, Lucan's ascension to the throne was not only swift, it was orchestrated in a manner that defies the supposed chaos on Capitol in the aftermath. Lucan's defenestration of the Moot, the quickness with which the royal family was buried, the quashing of any investigation into Varian's death, and his ability to sway the Imperial Household Bureaucracy and the Central Military Command could not have been accomplished by the new emperor on the basis of his own dubious merits and accomplishments. And finally there is the spectacle of the real Strephon, en route from Dynam Depot in Lishun Sector, being diverted from Capitol upon recieving the news of "his" assassination, instead of seizing control of the situation as he was so obligated to do by his office. 

The Usurpation theory explains these discrepancies as being a counterrevolution. Strephon was a reformist, and Dulinor's "reform movement" was actually of his own devising, since the Black Archduke's appointment would never have otherwise occured. Strephon wanted to save the Imperium, but as with all reform movements that are enacted when an empire is at an advanced age, they had a paradoxical effect. The empire had grown too old and too fragmented for his modest reforms to be enacted, as they did not satisfy aggrieved parties, and they threatened old elites too ossified to sacrifice their personal power and wealth. Several factions among the latter reacted negatively, first to Dulinor, and finally to Strephon, hamstringing reform. A cabal of reactionary nobles within the upper reaches of the Imperial government finally decided to remove Strephon, while at the same time creating the conditions for a rejuvenation of the Imperium that would preserve their priveleges and power intact. And Dulinor became their scapegoat. 

But as with most reactionary conspiracies, their clarity of foresight and thouroughness of planning did not extend beyond their plot. Their assumption was that once Strephon was dead, and Dulinor was implicated, the rest of the Imperium and the outside universe would accept this fait accompli, and everything would be magically restored. But of course the plotters did not know about Longbow, or of Strephons providential absence. Because Dulinor was to be the villian, and the designated means for imperial renewal, their planning did not account for any other actors to spoil the play. Nor did they sufficiently account for the ambitions of the Solomani or the oppurtunism of the Vargr. The main complaint against this theory is not only the lack of corroborating evidence, but the absurdity that reduces the greatest human tragedy in all recorded history, and reduces to a farce perpetrated by pathetic human hubris.

Lynx Society
Non-governmental scientific organisation headquartered from  Camaguey/Meizirn (Beyond 0409). Founded in 1133 following the Collapse to preserve, perpetuate and evolve scientific and technical knowledge in the face of the Viral threat. The Society is prestigious, as many governments, eager to forestall a further collapse, encouraged their scientists to join and pool their resources. The Society has branch offices on many industrial worlds, but is best represented in Beyond and nearby Vanguard Reaches. Membership is by invitation only, though its rolls include distinguished amateurs as well as professional and academic scientists. The Society has no research facilities of its own, but it does publish journals and maintains databases of recent unclassified discoveries in the sciences, engineering and humanities. All members pay modest dues, and digest subscriptions; but Society subsidises member research, and most of its income results from patents and royalties generated by such research. The society has a biannual convention that it convenes on various worlds in the Spinward Hinters. The society takes its name from the famous Italian Renaissance scientific society, the first of its kind on Terra, a brotherhood that included Galileo.

M-Theory

Precursor to J-space/Unified Hyperspace Theory. Unifies all of the various Superstring theories into one framework. Under normal mathematics, five different superstring regimes existed. Thanks to Witten on Terra, and Ploiabr on Zhdant, the five theories were unified around a semi-lucid unity called M-theory. Under this scheme the strings of superstring theory are converted into a single series of simple hyperspatial geometries, into which our universe could be identified. M-theory eventually, by reconciliation with other competing hyperspatial theories, became the basis for J-Space theory, and the invention of jump drive.

Manipulator Thruster

New TL-16/17 thruster currently under development by the Regency. Unlike the mythical Thruster Plate, which is simply perpetual motion applied to propulsion, a Manipulator Thruster is a reaction based engine. An MT generates a gravity well in front of a ship or vehicle, which provides acceleration. Because gravity is an infinite force, the velocities of all objects in the universe are affected to some small degree by this artificial gravity well, keeping the thruster within the bounds of thermodynamics and Newtons laws. Because a Manipulator doesn't provide a pushing thrust, but rather a pull down a gravitational gradient, engineers have dubbed it a "slide rocket." 

Problems with "gravitational pollution", whereby the effects of thousands of thrusters over a period of time can distort the paths upon all objects in a local solar system, have so far prevented deployment of the basic system, which has been in existence since the Imperial Civil War. Engineers are working on a Cycling Manipulator, so called because it creates a moving g-well that partially compensates for the gravitational momentum it creates in other objects in nearby proximity.

Metastable Metallic Hydrogen

When ordinary mono or diatomic hydrogen is compressed at pressures in excess of fifteen to twenty thousand atmospheres, internal repulsion between hydrogen atoms is overcome and metallic bonds are formed. This condition is "metastable", meaning that this substance only exists within a narrow range of circumstances, and will quickly revert to a more normal equilibrium with the right stimulus, such as compression in a fusion reactor. Nevertheless MMH is a very lightweight material, comparable in strength (though not density) to aluminum, and can be used as a strutural material in some commercial applications. 

MMH naturally occurs in stars and gas giants where the weight of the atmosphere and density of the gas become sufficient for its formation. At a depth of around 1000 to 2000 kms, a metallic "surface" of hydrogen will form in these bodies, one capable of conducting heat and electricity in the same manner as all other metallic substances. The existence of this phenomenon (Authors note: The following is merely my own educated opinion.) is important to the reconciliation of fusion processes, both "hot" and "cold" at TL-9. Cold Fusion is in a solid state, where a metallic catalyst creates a "crystal" of hydrogen that fuses into helium. Further surveys of solar "hot" fusion, where a high pressure solution of metallic hydrogen is mixed with metallic catalysts, is virtually no different than cold fusion, except for the scale. All working fusion reactors that have ever existed are high pressure gas-metal catalytic cells which compress powerplant hydrogen to a metallic state, thereby creating a fusion process that can be utilised for useful power.

Molecular Computers

Also known as Biocomputers. MCs utilise chemical reactions, such as the selective breaking of chemical bonds, for processing data. The most common processor is artificial DNA, whose periodic and algorithmic nature permits easy manipulation and design of chemical circuits. That same DNA also permits easy storage of memory. The first DNA computers are invented at TL-9, and become widely available starting at the upper limits of TL-10, replacing normal solid-state induction-gate processors like silicon and carbon. They replace silicon and other solid state memory media at TL-12. Because of the small size of DNA strands, and other biochemical relays, an MC can be built to very small scales, making them ideal for nanotechnological applications. Molecular Computers are immune to Viral infection, though some scientists wonder if that will always be the case.

Money Laundering

The conversion of money and assets from illegal activities into legal bonds, stocks and certificates. Money Laundering is made much easier in this day and age thanks to the slow flow of information and the sophistication of modern forgery. It was difficult even during the Antebellum period for any interstellar society to verify the source of "offshore" money flowing through their borders. Many states could do little more than "barricade" their money against currency manipulation, or tightened deposit rules, but otherwise left money flows virtually unregulated. Fortunately, the difficulty of currency conversion limited manipulation to "kiting", the use of unsecured bonds for use as collateral in obtaining loans and capital. Since the Collapse, the increasing need for economic cooperation has loosened currency regulations in many Spinward States, allowing for easier conversion of offshore money by criminal organisations. Beyond Sector and parts of Far Frontiers are the main centers for this illegal traffic.

Muirimianism

Religion practiced by the people of the Regency of Muirimi and the Nakris Confederacy. It is an "occulted sovereign" religion similar to Terran Rastifarianism and the Canuban cult. The religon centers around the (possibly apocryphal) person of Muirimi, alledgedly a high ranking member of the Terran military that was a Terran military governor of Daibei and then Zarushagar sectors during the latter stages of the Interstellar Wars. The cult transformed Muirimi from an obscure myth into a towering messianic figure. It proclaimed a philosophy of the chosen within the true faith, dedicated to equality and justice for the believers, and foretold a day when Muirimi would return to the world from his hiding place, and usher in an apocalyptic age. 

The cult emerged in Zarushagar during the Twilight period following the disintegration of the Rule of Man, mostly among the increasingly desperate lower classes of the region. When the remaining authorities tried to supress the religion in light of its anarchic attitude, a revolt erupted that led to the cult leaders and most of their followers fleeing across the Great Rift and settling in Beyond and Iphegenaia sectors. The original religion has been watered down into the mainstream Regency and the more pastoral Nakrisian heresy.

Nanogathics

Nanobots used to restore teleomeres. 

^^^^

Nanotechnology

Machinery that is constructed at the molecular level. First available at TL-10. Most Nanotech is primarily automated machinery used in manufacturing and medical applications. As most nanobots are generally too small and simple for viral infection, they have become a primary "antiviral" as they are quick, difficult to destroy, and often preserve most of the original hardware. 

Non-Governmental Organisations: Organisations that are dedicated to functions and causes that transcend normal nationalistic boundaries. Such organisations include charities, relief and aid services, and development agencies. The most famous and obvious example is the Traveller's Aid Society. 

Most NGOs BTC are primarily private information-for-fee agencies, private law enforcement services, medical relief, and several private exploratory companies in service to the Regency RQS or Frontier Exploratory and Contact Office (FECO).

Orbital Resonance

Modern theory of solar system formation. Contrary to the classical view of nebular accretion, nascent solar systems rarely possess neat, regimented orbital structures. In reality, the great differences in distribution in mass within an accretionary disk are so great, especially when gas giants are formed, that orbits are chaotic and disorderly. Gas giants and binary stars are either cannibalistic, swallowing smaller worlds, or bullying, hurling worlds out of a solar system alltogether. But as with most chaotic systems, order eventually emerges, and the system stabilises. In most cases orbiting objects will attain, through mutual gravitational influence, a resonant cycle where they support each other and stabilise each others orbits. Such orbital resonance is the main reason why habitable worlds exist, otherwise marauding gas giants will pilfer a system's life zone in nearly all other cases. Panspermia: Theory of life origin first postulated by the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras. The theory holds that all life originates in the vacuum of space. Amino acids have been shown to form in nebula clouds, and many bacteria are capable of subsisting in extreme conditions, including the cold of space and high levels of solar radiation. As nebula accretion forms a solar system, bolide impacts into volcanic rock seeds a young world with these amino acid/protolife contructs, where they can quickly establish themselves in the hot water circulating through the early crust and upper mantle. 

(This theory should really recieve an IMTU code of its own. Because it speculates that ALL life in the universe, regardless of its location, has the same origin, if not the same source. At one extreme there should exist a code for panspermia only, a middle code for a complex interaction between space and terrestrial genesis, and at the other extreme the spontaneous generation theory where life only develops because of some unknown alchemy within the hot rock and thick atmosphere of a young world.)

Passive Recuperative Systems

PRS are self-sustaining or self-perpetuating mechanical, electronic and biological systems designed to remain functional despite damage or viral infection. Also known as trapeze systems, for they are like a person on a trapeze who uses their momentum or balance to carry them through the air, and perform their stunts. Most of these systems are engineered towards maintaining simple functions, such as flight for a gravitic city, life support for a space station, hull integrity for a starship...etc. When damaged or stressed, they maintain enough inner fortitude or design flexibility to resist, or preferably, recuperate the energy or disintegration created to their continued function or perpetuation. Most PRS use smart materials and advanced bioorganic parts in their construction. Most are actually dumb systems, organised around passive or embedded algorhithm(s) that dominates their operations, and are therefore immune to everything but total destruction. Most critical life support, power distribution and certain automation systems constructed since 1132 are PRS.

Plague Reign

One of two sociological theories concerning the Viral Wilds that exist in the Regency (See Turk's Reign). This theory proposes that the situation in the Wilds is similiar to that which existed on Terra's European continent following the Black Death pandemic. 

Virus, like the Black Death, wiped out a good portion of the preexisting sentient population. In this case about 99.7 percent of all life. The majority of survivors are to be found upon more habitable worlds, generally T-norms and T-primes, where less reliance upon advanced technology allowed for most of their populations to survive the viral onslaught. Nonetheless the near destruction of the world that these survivors once knew has had a pronounced effect upon their worldview, beliefs and ideologies. The old Imperial system has been destroyed, and a social evolution is underway that is attempting to replace the old ways with customs and ideas more suitable for local circumstances. 

The massive die off makes skilled labor both rare and extremely precious. Even where worlds have suffered only minor casualties, there exists great need for people with the technological and professional skills required for reconstruction. As with post-Black Death Europe, such skilled workers are likely to be the main economic commodity, both within their communities and wherever interstellar travel has been preserved. Aggressive behavior by local warlords is likely to be more restrained in hopes of attracting and retaining the services of such journeymen. Where local circumstances are favorable, such workers may even pool their resources and begin the instruction of new workers, allowing for an extension of the total knowledge base for an accelerated recovery and the wider benefits of educational advancement and enfrancisement.

Plan B Colonies

Colonies established in Fulani and Theron sectors by the Spinward States in the wake of the Rape of Trin. Following the successful attack by the Kishkii and her fleet, the possibility of further successful penetrations of the Quarantine convinced several Spinward States to "hedge their bets." A consortium of private Regency, Zhodani and Spinward Hinter colonial ventures were established with the view of colonising the uninhabited worlds of Fulani, Astron and other spinward sectors on the backside of the Spinward Extents from the Wilds. With assistance from the Regency's Space Exploration and Contact Office and its private "Frontiersman" contractors, several colonial ventures were launched in the 1140s and 50s, concentrating in the trailing half of Fulani sector.

Punctuated Equilibrium

Significant modification of evolutionary theory, first proposed by Solomani scientist Stephen Jay Gould. Unlike normal Darwinian evolution and its assumption of a steady level of mutation, PE stipulates that the development of new species is an uneven process. While mutation is constant, a level of biological equilibrium is generally maintained over the course of the prevailing climactic or geological period, and these mutations are suppressed in favor of the more successful species. Conversely, when that period is disrupted, these mutations are no longer supressed, and the more successful and viable mutations become dominant in a short period of geological time. Past assumptions about speciation was that it took millions of years, under PE it may take only 10,000-20,000 years to accomplish. The emergence of Virus, while conducive to the PE model, has a rapidity that has challenged even that conservative number, and some biologists are already arguing for Viral specialisation over the next 300 to 400 years.

Poison Pills

Anti-viral devices that activate when viral infection of the system it is emplaced occurs. Either the virus is killed, or the system will self-destruct. Such systems include exothermic/endothermic chemical cells, explosives, powersurge strips, and disconnective circuit breakers.

Pygmalion Paradox

The tendency of technology, as it becomes more advanced or complex, to reflect increasingly primitive or lifelike tendencies, or the foibles and limitations of its creators. By approaching the threshold of sentience, or life imitation, technology becomes more beholden to its embedded design ideology, and more autonomous of personal control. Machines evolve a "secret life" that increasingly isolates users from their more essential functioning. The result is a technological world that is surreal and neo-animistic, with strong parallels to the worlds conjured in ancient or traditional myth structures.

Quantum Computer

A computer that utilizes Quantum Mechanical operations as a processor. Imagine that a person has misplaced an important briefcase in a high-rise office building. The person remembers is that he placed in a desk in one of the hundreds of offices inside the building, but has no recollection of which office on which floor...etc. Now he could check each office, one at a time, but that would take forever, and he has to find it right now. But what if he cloned himself a number of times equal to the number of offices? Each clone would be able to check one office each, and the probability that the briefcase will be found as quickly as possible is nearly 100 percent. A quantum computer works in much the same fashion. The base science of QM is the idea that an electron is not a hard or discrete "meatball" of matter, but rather a dispersed if not phantasmic energy wave whose position is rather uncertain at any given instant. To determine the probable positio of an electron, physicists use wave functions, which is a number matrix that defines that probability. But since an electrons position is a probability, a Quantum computer can function in much the same way that our forgetful busninessman found his briefcase, by expressing a computational algorithm as a wave function, permitting the algorithm to "check each room at the same time" so to speak. Quantum computers were first invented at TL8/9, but do not become practical until TL-10, and in wide commercial and military use until TL-13. Early QCs relied upon supercooled liquids and lasers to chill the computational medium to above absolute zero, removing thermodynamic interference and placing it at the ground state most conducive for problem solving. Later computers use magnets, "Quantum Traps" and gravitic technologies; contemporary systems use new subatomic and "quantum gate" technology to further enhance their power. QCs are immune to Viral infection.

Quantum Teleportation

Method of teleportation using "Quantum Entanglement." Teleportation via signal transmission was once thought to be impossible, because of the difficulties created by the Uncertainty Principle, where the method of analysing the atomic and subatomic particles in an object actually disrupts the information inherent to them. But a number of advanced physics, utilising the QE effect, otherwise known as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox, have successfully created perfect copies of quanta. The only stipulation is that the original copy be destroyed (a method of teleportation described in Traveller canon). 

^^^^

Normal mechanical teleportation, for a number of scientific and technical reasons, has been shown to be impossible. The bigger and the more massive the object to be scanned, and then transmitted, the more difficult it is for even powerful computers to encompass every particle, without errors from developing during scanning. Even with the QE method, errors are inevitable. However, teleportation of small (<5 kilograms) objects may one day be possible. Even more interesting is the idea that certain materials do not have to be carried between worlds as bulk cargo: if they are small enough, they can be carried electronically on a courier or X-boat, and be downloaded into a copying or cloning machine at its destination. 

^^^^

Quarantine

The defensive cordon of customs and military forces, combined with protective technical protocols, intended to prevent infection by the AI Virus. The Quarantine was the main focus of the Spinward Accords: signing created an obligation for each member state "to create, uphold and maintain certain regulations aimed at preventing viral infection among the Spinward States, and building and maintaining sufficient forces to enforce the Quarantine at all necessary points of their space...... within a reasonable framework that can be considered responsible within the tenets of the Accords." This last bit of text permits some leeway to signers to create a Quarantine within the contexts of their own particular circumstances, without undermining the common defense and welfare of the Spinward States as a whole. 

This little bit of wriggle room has created a wide and varying degree of interpretations of a Quarantine that is "considered responsible" by the whole. Arguably the strictest Quarantine is maintained by the largest Spinward States: the Regency, the Aslan along the Rift and the Zhodani. Regulations generally become more lax, and enforcement less stringent as one gets farther away from the trailing "hot zone." Within the more spinward reaches, especially the New Colonies in Fulani or Theron sectors, or regions farther along the Zhodani Shadow, the Quarantine exists mainly in name rather than in fact.

Quintessence

Also known as Dark Energy or Cosmic Inflation. A theory that explains the apparent "Horizon" paradox posed by the Big Bang theory. Measurements of the oldest observable stars in the universe purport to show a universe that is approx. 15 billion years old. But measurements of those objects with the greatest red shifts show a universe that is far larger (approx. 17-19 billion light years) than what should be observed. This is akin to travelling in a car across a featureless plain at about 100 km per hour for one hour, stopping after one hour of driving and measuring the distance travelled with a laser, and finding that you've travelled 120 km. Cosmic Inflation states that the vacuum that all matter "floats" in is itself undergoing expansion with the rest of the universe. The 20 km discrepancy you experienced while driving can be explained if the ROAD had been stretching at 20 km/hr by itself while the car had been moving. Quintessence is postulated as the energy that is creating this expansion, and is thought to be resistant to normal gravitational attraction.

Regency 231st Fleet

Regency Intelligence unit stationed at Auitawry and Sarage. The 231st was built upon the old Crosshairs courier route, and has been instrumental in the interception of large Vampire Fleets crossing the Verge Connector into the vulnerable knot of the Aslan Colonies. The fleet was originally a complicated mixture of intel gathering, courier and special operations forces designed for both early warning of Vampire movements, and to recover vital personnel and technology from the Federation of Ilelish and Usdiki. Because of its remote location, and vital strategic role, the fleet maintains combat units of its own. Usually these are ships captured or salvaged in fighting in Verge and Ilelish sectors, whether viral infected or not. The 231st works closely with the Aslan Quarantine forces, and is permitted limited access to their facilities in trailing Trojan Reach. Because of its peculiar position, only the best military and RQS personnel are assigned to its ranks. In 1149 the worlds of Tisilli and Browne were ceded by the Aslan, and are currently under the protection of the 231st. 

^^^^

Regency 269th Fleet

Regency intelligence unit stationed at Errogel/Atsah. The 269th, like its sister the 231st to rimward, is charged with intelligence gathering along the Wildside approaches to the Regency frontier. Its area of responsibility are Corridor, Vland, Tuglikki, Provence, and technically all of the sectors stretching to trailing along the old Imperial/Vargr border, and the entire Vargr Extents, though in practice this is impossible. Unlike their sister fleet, the 269th lacks frontline military units of its own, and extensive ties to the Joint Special Operations Command; but it compensates through the maintenance of an extensive free trader network that provides reliable data from as far as trailing Corridor and Provence.

Regnecy Starship Shortage

The Domain of Deneb was totally unprepared for the onslaught of Virus in 1131. Even worse, the battering of the Civil War and Aslan and Vargr invasions made it difficult to quickly adjust to the new threat. To defend against the growing flow of vampire fleets making their way across or around the Great Rift, the new Regency of Deneb needed as many warships as could be constructed in a short amount of time. The ensuing shortage of ships came as something of a shock, given the massive capacity that had existed BTC for several centuries, but this can be explained for a number of reasons. 

Had it merely been a matter of new construction, and higher priorities on military construction, the disruption of civilian starship markets would have been bad enough. Regency/DoD shipbuilders had to also upgrade and modify tens of thousands of already extant starships to new virus resistant computer and communication systems, diverting scarce resources and space to this necessary project. The economic recession that came out of commercial contraction during the Civil War had robbed shipbuilders of the capital needed for expansion or upgrades of their yards, and equipment and personnel were in many cases inadequate for the task. While the Regency government and its new Ministry of Shipping managed to subsidise new shipyard construction, and alleviate crowding, a disruption of new civilan ship construction was unavoidable. 

Factors outside of starship construction also contributed to shortages. The Abandonment took thousands of starships out of normal paying service along the critical starlanes of what would later be called the Regency Stronghold. Despite careful scheduling, an acute shortage of merchant vessels caused a massive jump in freight fees, and several worlds had great difficulty in shipping or recieving vital goods. Coupled with a growing population and a greater reliance upon internal trade, the market for new starships was too exorbitantly expensive for most buyers. It wasn't until around 1150 that enough yard space, producing enough new starships, under enough careful management of the Shipping Ministry that the market finally began to tip towards new buyers; but by that time the damage had been done. 

The panic of the early Collapse had forced the induction of thousands of older obsolete and obsolescent merchant and military vessels into service, and many of these have only been removed from active service in the last decade or so. The "shortage" has been over since 1170, but these older ships, and lingering demand by the military, still creates anxiety within the public.

Repulsor Weaponry

Weapons that propel a projectile through the use of a repulsor generated gravity well, which proceeds away from the muzzle of the weapon. Repulsor guns have several distinct advantages over conventional weapons. The gravity well does not require a CPR gun's long barrel for stablisation, nor the complex electronic assemblies of gauss weapons. And acceleration of the round can continue AFTER it leaves the barrel. In artillery applications, the projection of gravitational effects can permit rounds to be shot in sinous or non-ballistic paths to avoid being shot down or betraying their launcher by their paths. Engineers have also played with creating "ablative pockets", an insulating outer liner, when combined with the air pocket created by the gravity well, permits higher round velocities in excess of what is permissible normal weapons. Repulsor Weapons are still largely experimental, and only a few Regency Army units, and the Mora and Vincennes world armies, have deployed them in regular frontline service.

Scapegoat

A ship or piece of technology set out as bait for vampire ships or fleets. These are generally dilapidated small merchant ships, that usually loiter above prime refueling areas. These ships contain skeletal crews, and always operate in conjunction with a concealed naval squadron, usually battle riders or SDB's hidden in the upper reaches of a gas giant, underwater, or in the sensor shadows of asteroids and small moons. 

^^^^

Slingshot

A military strategy that places the logistical support arm of a military force into the vanguard of the advance. This strategy recognises that a military advance only goes as fast as its supply lines will allow it. Therefore rather than allowing forces to advance at will, outstripping their resupply, the pace of advance is limited to the pace with which supply and support units can maintain by themselves. Generally this requires more resources be spent upon logistical mobility, and the development of smaller, more mobile combat units. It is speculated by some that the Regency has spent the majority of the resources allocated to a possible reconquest of the former Imperium upon fleets of supply ships, mobile depots and forward emplaced supply caches in the Rift just for such an eventuality. 

^^^^

Smart Guns

Guns that are built with computer guidance and advanced sensors to optimise their lethality. Smart Gun technology first appears at TL-9, but really come into their own with the widespread deployment of gauss weapons. These guns include ballistic computers, IGS/GPS positioning, laser guidance and other high-tech enhancements commonly found on vehicle units. More advanced TL-12+ weapons include "carriage" barrels cushioned on superconducting magnets to improve accuracy, waldo stabilised "steady guns", look-shoot-kill heads up displays, and self-guiding ammunition. TL-14+ weapons incorporate material density sensors to be used in conjunction with 

^^^^

Smart Materials

Generally a reference to materials that can be "programmed" or specially modified to change or react to different or changing circumstances. More specifically it refers to materials that are constructed at the molecular, atomic and subatomic levels to be complex microengineering systems in their own right, actively or passively adapting to changes they sense in the outside environment. 

The first smart materials are TL 6 and 7 "memory metals", alloys that can revert to their originally casted forms despite deformation. Most early smart materials rely upon simple chemical properties; later materials are literally constructed one atom at a time through the use on nanoprobes and advanced computer modelling. Many TL-9+ materials literally become advanced algorhithmic systems in their own right. 

TL-10 to 13 materials include advanced molecular construction, "frameworking" or resonant feedback materials, materials with microcircuitry and nanocapacitors, "free-energy" nanomaterials that generate electrical current from friction or environmental heat. 

TL-14 and higher materials include microgravitic nanowell impregnation, quantitized spontaneous energy release (which is to say they can create laser energy at certain energy states), strong-weak force doping, supercritical phase shifters (they turn from solid to plastic to liquid, or liquid to plastic to solid depending to their circumstances),vacuum nano-crystallisation, and hyperspatial energy shunting. 

^^^^

Snakehead Rounds

Bullets that carry a discrete energy pattern optimised for the material they will penetrate. Snakehead rounds are designed around liquid polymer explosives, that is "staged" by an internal nanotech catalyst. In conjunction with a smart gun equipped with a densitometer or density reading laser, the internal nannites arrange themselves into a colloidal structure that directs explosive energy according to the internal resonance of the material that it must penetrate or destroy.

Space Exploration and Contact Office ( SECO )

Independent Regency government agency established in the aftermath of the disestablishment of the Regency Interstellar Scout Service's Exploration Office.

Superstring Theory

First hyperspatial theory to be developed upon Terra and Zhdant. The theory emerged out of a growing interest in application of Relativity theory within spatial dimensions beyond the normal three. In higher dimensions, relativity can be reconciled with quantum mechanics in a rather interesting manner. This includes a "crystalline" state for the emergence of the hitherto invisible graviton. But this reconciliation requires that the abstract "point" particle of classical physics be replaced with a tangible but dispersed one dimensional "string" or two dimensional membrane (see M-theory for the latter). The theory's mathematics were extremely complex even for starflight era physics, and it eventually game way to M-theory. 

^^^^

Technology of Humility

New technological paradigm in fashion with the Spinward States since the Collapse. Enshrines a greater skepticism about the benefits of technological advancement. The benefits of trailblazing research and development is now weighed by the public and institutions against its possible social cost, whether in increased alienation or environmental impact. The novelty of technology is now less important than its quality of construction, ability to enhance the quality of life, and its relative usefulness. The most pronounced application is the growing nanotechnology trend within the Regency. 

^^^^

Teleomeric Regeneration

Teleomeres are sections of DNA, found in every lifeform, that regulate the number of cell divisions any particular kind of cell may undergo before terminating. Teleomeres usually come in bundles of distinct sections, which progressively shorten with each cell reproduction. Eventually the telemeres terminate, and the cell simply dies without further division. These "death clocks" regulate aging to a major extent. Normal anagathics can slow or temporarily prevent this shortening, but the long term goal is to create a means of permanent regeneration, possibly with the use of so called Nanogathics. 

The Third Imperium had been pursuing such research feverishly before the Civil War, and a number or research stations in the Domain of Deneb were part of this research effort. The massive research infrastructure needed to combat Virus, and the public outcry over Imperial subsidence of percieved class inequalities like aging research (which only the wealthy could technically afford) compelled the Regency to abandon the field to private companies. Most aging research is now undertaken by the "DNA Valley" on Magash/Sabine, with assistance from nanotech companies on Mora and Vincennes.

Transstar Deneb

The strangest story in Imperial or Regency corporate history. In the aftermath of the First Solomani Rim War, SolSec discovered that the Verge Connector was poorly defended by the Third Imperium against outside intrusion or espionage. Using a number of front companies, a spy operation codenamed "Crosshairs" was established in nearby Hlakhoi sector under the cover of the Aslan Hierate. For security reasons, the only connection between these "cutouts" was a network of Transstar subsidiary companies operating legitimately within the border region between the Hierate and the Solomani Confederacy. Crosshairs was successful enough at penetrating Imperial security that the operation was expanded into a major courier and espionage network running through the Hierate, jumping the Rift, and terminating among the minor client states of the Trojan Reach and Beyond Sectors. An information and assistance channel was even opened up between SolSec and the Zhodani, though that never panned out the way the two groups had hoped. 

The breakout of the Imperial Civil War caused a feverish increase in operations for Crosshairs. Its "backdoor" into the Federation of Ilelish gave it a frontrow seat into the main battlefront of the war, and its agents were only too happy to launch provocative strikes against both Lucan and Dulinor. As the war dragged out, contact was made with the growing opposition in some parts of the Federation to Dulinors increasingly authoritarian rule; evidence exists that a sizeable amount of support for the Verge Secession came from Crosshairs. But by that time rifts serious rifts had developed within the Solomani leadership, and the position of Solomani companies within the Hierate was being compromised by the dragging out of the Civil War. Several SolSec operatives turned freelance, or came into contact with interested Imperial factions, as a means of their own survival. 

Around 1121 a number of operatives stationed among the Human client states BTC were induced into defecting to the Domain of Deneb, and they brought their spycraft and diplomatic experience with them. Several Crosshair operatives helped to negotiate the safe passage of the Arrival Vengeance mission through the Aslan Hierate, and their success encouraged other critical SolSec operatives to seek out employment or safe haven within the DoD. By 1128, DoD intelligence had parasatized the entire courier network with double agents under the auspicies of Operation Unicorn. This network became critical during the early months of the Collapse, permitting an uninterrupted diplomatic and information contact with the Aslan Colonies, and in the evacuation of vital Imperial personnel and materials via the Verge Connector. The network even evacuated a number of Solomani, Daibeian and Ilelishi naval personnel from Magyar and Dark Nebula sectors. 

The shortage of starships that ensued within the Regency created a new utility for the former Crosshair personnel. The courier network was institutionalised as a public company, using the Transstar name, and was immediately put to work in helping coordinate the Abandonment, and effectively managing starship distribution during that difficult period. When the Abandonment ended, the company was semi-privatised and subsidised, and became a universal service company intended to maintain starship distribution and reliable freight service until enough starships could be built to restore profitable private service. It has been noted that Transstar Deneb has supplanted Imperiallines Deneb as the Regency's primary support and courier service, as it larger freighter hulls are easily convertable into auxiliary warships and support transports for Quarantine service. 

Transstar Deneb is headquartered from Mora, but maintains offices at most Regency A and B class starports. The company maintains a general freight and passenger office, a courier and express cargo service in conjunction with the X-Web, and a "public service" office that works with the Regency military and intelligence services. The company retains strong ties to the security services, and most of its higher executives and nearly all of its crews are ex-military. About twenty percent of its fleet is in the RQS or Naval Auxiliary. In recent years the company has slowly abandoned the universal service decree of its original charter, and has begun positioning itself for expansion into the Wilds pending approval from the Regency Senate.

Turk Reign

One of two Regency sociological theories regarding the Viral Wilds. Where Plague Reign tends to minimise the impact of Virus to that of a passing epidemic, Turk's Reign incorporates the increasing adaptability of Virus to human technology, and its growing ability to manipulate its environment. The Wilds are more akin to the European portion of the old Ottoman Turk empire on old Terra in the period of 1453-1918 CE. 

The Turkish Empire was a ramshackle tyranny, dominated by a military elite that became glutted and lazy upon its massive conquests of nearly a third of Europe, and major portions of the Near East and North Africa. When it was challenged by European powers, its rule became frightfully corrupt and brutal. It taxed its subjects to the quick. Its courts and officials were graft prone. Its soldiers and police were brutal, and were given to punitive plundering and rape. It shackled its subjects under a backwards and primitive medievalism that was hostile to the intellect and speculative thought, or any kind of dissent. And its high officials ruled the lands with a heavy and clumsy hand at all times. Under this constant harassment, the lands and peoples under their rule fell behind the west, and in many cases regressed into brutality and corruption of their own. When they were finally liberated, they were left to fight among themselves over the scraps left to them by their departed overlords, with little or no chance of obtaining the fruits of modernity for themselves. 

The Wilds, according to this comparitive view, are under the sovereignty of the crazed and erratic Virus and its Vampire Fleets. As with the Plague's Reign Theory, the population dieback that occured has greatly increased the value of skilled labor, but the heavyhanded nature of the worst of Vampires and Virus has returned the former Imperium back to a premodern time of fear and introspection. Travellers are subject to attack at all times; bandits flourish alongside predatory Vampire ships, and every surviving settlement is subject to attack, reprisal and the "tax" of enforced servitude to a Vampire fleet or human slaver. The chances that the Wilds can recover in a positive form without outside assistance are practically nil.

Vaccines

Lobotomised or domesticated viruses used to protect a system against infection by a hostile virus. Most vaccines are experimental, and controversial. Most are chimera's, engineered mixtures of viral chip-codes and anthrogenic material. Public activism is buttressed in this area by academic, humanitarian and professional objections to its amoral and unethical implications, and the percieved instability of most of these systems.

Van Kreden's Death Ride

The quixotic misadventure of one Baren Von Kreden, a nobleman native to Gungnir/Sword Worlds. In 1112 the de facto ruler of Gungnir, a certain "King" Arthur, was assassinated by a young woman. Xenophobic elements within the planetary nobility declared that his death was the result of an Imperial plot, and attempted to whip up local sentiment against the Imperium. But as is usually the case with Sword Worlders, the frenzy broke down into internecine fighting over the right of succession, and that should have ended an possibility of retaliation against the Imperium. Van Kreden, one of Arthur's most fervent if unbalanced supporters, stood back from the fray, and assembled a ramshackle fleet in orbit. In mid 1112, the fleet left Gungnir, penetrated the Imperial border, and attacked Frenzie. The local defense squadron destroyed Van Kreden's followers to a man, though not the demented baron. Undaunted, perhaps even emboldened, by the destruction of his forces, the baron jumped outsystem, and then steadily blazed a trail of senseless, pointless violence across the Spinward Marches. His journey culminated at Mora, where he set his ship into a kamikaze dive towards the newly constructed Giyachii arcology and the incomplete Domain capitol, oblivious to the resistance of both the 73rd Fleet and the local SDB squadron. His fervent determination proved no match for a full BatRon that had just arrived from Core, and he was slaughtered before he even made geosynchronous orbit. 

Despite its obvious stupidity, his act of suicidal defiance inspired several similar terrorist acts among other deranged Sword Worlders, though none matching its scale. After the Sword World Occupation, Van Kreden became a mythic figure among hardline resistance movements, inspiring yet more suicidal acts by Anti-Regency terrorists. Among Regency immigrants in the occupied Sword Worlds, and even many Sword Worlders, to be a "Van Kreden" is to be engaged in a pointless, futile and shallow endeavor.

Ventana Project

Controversial research project carried out at the Rift Sector Research Station Gamma in the Regency during the 1150-1160s. Full disclosure of the project has never occured, but allegations of mind control experiments have surfaced in relation to this project. Ventana is mentioned in the RASAC archives leaked in 1201.

Verge Connector

J-5 to 6 route that crosses the Great Rift from trailing Verge sector to the Aslan Hierate and Riftspan Reaches Sector. In Antebellum times, the Connector was a minor trade route, though an important courier route between the Third Imperium and the Hierate. The Connector is now infamous for being the conduit that brought Virus into the Aslan Hierate. Because of the short lag time with which Virus reached it, the Hierate had no advanced warning, and its most heavily populated trailing regions were quickly annihilated. The Connector has remained a common means for Vampire Fleet deployment between the hot zone of the Imperial Core, and regions to spinward of the Great Rift, and it has been fortified by a mixture of Aslan and Regency forces since the Collapse.

Vermillion Stance Incident

The seizure in 1078 of the Lightning class cruiser Vermillion Stance by Zhodani forces in the Trojan Reach. The Stance was a former military vessel transferred to the IISS for use as an emissary vessel among the Imperial culture client states to rim and spinward. This was done in an effort to forestall Zhodani influence in this critical region. On the ships first shakedown mission, Zhodani agents armed with its itinerary ambushed and seized the ship at Garrone (Beyond 2217). This operation did not have the authorization of the Garronean government, and in the resulting blowback the Zhodani were permanently expelled from the Federation of Garrone. The incident also damaged ties to several other Beyond and Vanguard Reach states, reversing one hundred years of careful diplomacy by the Consulate. The crew of the Stance was returned to the Third Imperium after the Fourth Frontier War, but a good deal of local bitterness remained. Finally, in 1133 the Zhodani Consulate returned the Vermillion Stance to its original owners along with an apology and indemnity to both the Regency and the Garroneans.

Viral Psychosis

The psychological pathology of the AI Virus. Nearly all viruses that exist within human technology is to some degree insane. At first it was thought that this was the result of deliberate engineering by the Virus Project engineers and scientists, but it now seems to be an accidental result of rapid environmental change. 

Ultimately the hubris that created Virus and destroyed the Third Imperium was the oversight by the Research Station Omicron engineers of the level of sentience that existed within the original Cymbeline chip. Call it racism or specism, but it appears that they saw no difference between the natural environment of the chips homeworld, and the silicon adapted for use in technology. They could uproot the chip from its natural ecology, insert it within the artificial environment of a computer or processor, and it would be no different than before. 

Imagine that a person catches a virus from a whale, a virus that contains the dna for the whale's brain and nervous system. The person becomes sick, and lapses into a coma while the virus turns its brain into that of a whale's. Of course a whale is a much different animal than a person, it swims in the sea and eats krill, while the person walks on land and cooks by fire. When the whale mind wakes up in the person, it is in fact in an alien body and environment. It goes insane because it has no means of adaptation, or means of learning how to become a person. That is the pathology of virus in summary. 

When the early Sampson strain virus was injected into specifically designed and etched silicon chips, it was essentially an alien world, and it would go berserk and eventually kill itself and the system it had infected. However some strains of virus managed to adapt to this new environment, but only in a haphazard way. Some of the Whale viruses, let's say, manage to learn some of the ways of a person. But it is still a novel thing, and its body is still rather alien to it. And the moral judgement that would come to it as a consequence of its surroundings has to learned, and that is the most difficult test for sentient creatures. When this alieness is combined with the great fecundity of a virus, say the whale virus can be passed from the person it infected to every other mammal it encounters, from elephants to gerbils, then it will naturally pass into a heightend sense of power that is recognisable as being a psychotic state.

Virtuoso

Rare substrain of the Hobbyist strain virus. These are "artistic" viruses with a preternatural ability at operating their hardware, or show genius or inspiration within a narrow scientific, technical or sociological field. In most cases they operate at an efficiency that often exceeds the original parameters of their hardware and its peripherals. However, like normal Hobbyists, these systems are narrowly interested, and have been compared to opera divas in their "prima donna" attitudes towards anything outside of their area of expertise.

Wavers

Tunable lasers capable of creating EMP effects. As early as TL-8, lasers could be induced to create an electromagnetic signal that could adversely affect living organisms. At higher tech levels, these signals could be modified and manipulated to create certain interfering effects, either with machinery or living organisms. Most wavers are generally at the lower end of the laser spectrum: visible light tending towards microwaves, VLF and electrical discharge. Wavers are illegal in the Regency, outside of military and police custody. These weapons include microwave "heartstoppers", "spark guns" and neural weaponry. 

^^^^

Weather Control

The science of weather diversion, modification, manipulation and creation. The idea behind it is rather simple. All weather is a form of energy transfer in a fluid medium, usually in the form of water vapor in the stratosphere. Changing that energy level can at the very least modify the path or characteristics of a storm. The first use of weather control technology is at TL-5, by the release of Nucleotides, metallic agents like silver iodide that attract moisture. By releasing these agents in front of a dangerous storm front like a tornadic or funnel cloud system, raindrops would form, removing energy from the total system. While effective, these early methods are a long way from actually controlling weather. 

All modern systems from TL-9 onwards utilize transmission of discrete electromagnetic energy into the atmosphere. The most common method is to use microwave transmitters in orbit to "knockdown" tornados and hurricanes before they form. But the most advanced systems utilise a world's ionosphere. The ionosphere is the thin but highly energetic layer of a T-norm or T-primes atmosphere that is energised by the solar wind. For a size 8 world, this "auroral" layer carries a 50,000 amp current at nearly a million volts of potential. Using a process called ionosphere heating (first proposed by the Solomani "mad scientist" Nikolai Tesla), Very Low Frequency radio waves at very high (1.5 to 5 million watt) energies are transmitted into the ionosphere, increasing or decreasing the altitude of that energy, and thereby altering the amount of energy available for weather formation within the lower stratosphere. 

These current systems formerly in use within the Third Imperium are descended from the ancient Solomani HAARP (High Altitute Auroral Research Project) system, which was originally intended for use by the American military as a disruptive weapon system. TL 9-11 Auroral systems are usually ground based near the poles; more advanced systems are orbital based.

White Wings

Regency medical aid and relief society headquartered on Regina. The organisation is modeled upon the ancient Terran charity Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders). The society maintains a fleet of modified subsidised liners and 1000 ton j-3 freighters outfitted as hospital and relief ships. The Wings have one or two bases in every settled subsector in the Spinward Extents, and these have one or two medical ships on standby alert for emergency response. Several ships are not fixed to a base, however, and are under contract to frontier regions, bring medical care to impoverished or underdeveloped worlds on the fringes of the safe, following a regular schedule. The valuable nature of these missions requires that the society maintains a large security force to protect against hijack or theft. 

^^^^

Wildside

In reference to the Vampire Wilds. Usually used to describe military duty for units that have operated for long periods of time outside the Regency Safe or Frontier, among Virus and Vampire Fleets. 

^^^^

X-Change

The virtual stock market of the Regency. In conjunction with corporate rechartering, the Regency had to have some means of restoring financial health to its surviving corporations, for whom the majority of shareholders lived in the Imperial Core. The X-Change was incorporated into the new X-Web, allowing for share and market data to be constantly updated and relayed to investors throughout the Regency, and sometimes beyond. Despite some early teething problems (and near market crashes) in the first few decades, the universal availability of stock options and equities, and more importantly the addition of less volatile bonds, allowed the surviving companies to quickly recoup their financial situations in the first decade of the Dreamtime. 

^^^^

Aika-Namon

Cartel created out of the merger of Aika Mining and Namon Systems in 1134. Headquarted on Efate. The company is unusually aggressive, in many ways harkening back to the Imperial past with its choice of tactics, but has generally kept out of trouble in its Regency operations. The company has a strong presence in the Four Corners region of the Spinward Marches, but has operations all over the Regency and most of the Marches and Trojan Reach. 

^^^^

Bailey-Harbour

Small but well regarded shipbuilder in the Spinward Marches. BH is headquartered on Regina, but does most of its business in Jewell, Vilis and Lanth subsectors. Its product line is centered around the production of Type A and A2 traders, Fat Traders, and several specialty and modular freighter designs held under patent by the company exclusively. BH does most of its business by referral, and does not produce very many ships annually. But its quality is very high, and its waiting list averages four years. In 1193 the company bought a new shipyard on Tanoose/Vilis, one that has been orientated towards the low end market, and produces the new Spartan class modular merchant for independents and small companies. 

^^^^

DMZ

The old Demilitarised Zone created between the Third Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate, in a large swath of coreward Spinward Marches. This was the result of the armistice that ended the Third Frontier War. The territory ceded by the Third Imperium to create this zone comprised a very large area in Jewell, Querion and Vilis subsectors, and includes a number of Imperial culture worlds that have become independent powers, including the Federation of Arden. The region has long been the main meeting ground between the old Third Imperium and the Zhodani. It has also been a region of power jockeying between the Imperium/Regency, Zhodani, Federation of Arden and the Darrian Confederation.

Ebokin

The Ebokin are methane breathers, and live in conditions near zero degrees centigrade. 

^^^^

Garoo Republic

Former small polity formed by Garoo (SM 0130) in the early Civil War period. Garoo was settled about the same time that Daryen was reached by the Izmir Corporation, and bad blood has existed with the Darrian Confederation stemming from its attempts to annex the world during its Golden Age. The Darrian Renaissance that resulted from the Fifth Frontier War, and the weakening of Imperial control over the Confederation just prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, concerned Garoo so much that it formed a military junta, and annexed its old colony of Uniqua (SM 0129) in 1116. Escalating tensions with the Darrians came to a boil after the announcement of the Quarantine, and Republic forces invaded Kardin (SM 0429), Bularia (0430) and Dorannia (SM 0530) after these worlds were illegally annexed by the Confederacy in 1132. The resulting Garoo War cost Garoo a large part of their military, and forced it to become a Regency Client State. The war did force the Regency to scotch further Darrian territorial ambitions, and accelerated the expansion of its area of responsibility into trailing Foreven Sector. 

^^^^

Kaldi Research

Prominent research and general science firm in the Regency. Kaldi has two main branches: a dirtside branch that does research for governments and corporations, and a spaceside branch that loans research and survey ships and their crews to various parties for whatever purposes their clients have in mind. Kaldi operates at least three Regency research stations in the Spinward Marches: Beta on Yori/Regina, Epsilon on Vreibefger/Lanth, and Eta on Judice/Plankwell. Kaldi tends to concentrate in the physical sciences, and avoids military contracts whenever possible. 

^^^^

MainLines

Small shipping company headquartered on Quiru/Lunion. The company had "sailed close to the wind" in the antebellum and Civil War period, and it apparently continued its illegal operations even after the Quarantine was imposed. Its crews engaged in widespread smuggling, with company knowledge and even encouragement, and MoJ and RQS were forced to intervene. In 1143 the company's headquarters were raided, much of its personnel were jailed and subsequently convicted of Quarantine violations, and Quiru recieved its much hated RQS administration all as a result of MainLines inability to recognise the changing of the times. 

^^^^

March Lines

Famous operator of subsidised merchants. The company was founded by the crew of the legendary March Harrier in 1110, and was notorious for its run ins with Imperial authorities. The company was a slow grower, possessing about a dozen small traders that operated in Regina and Aramis subsectors. The demise of its old nemesis, Tukera Lines, resulted in the purchase of several dozen ships in the Fire Sale, and the later acquisition of a part of Tukera's maintenance facility on Natoko/Aramis. The company has been headquartered out of Aramis' Leedor Downport since 1132. 

^^^^

Mewey

Humanoid species native to Mewey/Five Sisters (SM 0838). Mewey are bipeds roughly similar to humans in size and body chemistry. A very peaceable species, nevertheless they strongly resisted the Third Imperium's attempts at assimilating their world into its frontiers. The Collapse induced them to accept inclusion into the much smaller Regency of Deneb, and only after Norris' people made several concessions. The Mewey are enthusiastic traders, and have strong ties with several Aslan trading companies. Mewey are mostly found on their homeworld or their colony on nearby Ochecate (SM 0837). 

^^^^

Midway

The old Imperial-era trade route from Rhylanor, through Sabine, Inar, Namidshur and coreward Vincennes and Star Lane subsectors. This region was very heavily developed in antebellum times. Even in those days there existed deeply ingrained technological and economic rivalries between the leading worlds of the region. In contrast to the Stronghold, the Midway held all of Deneb Sectors highest technology. Competition was a four way tug between Magash/Sabine, Starn/Inar, Rhylanor/Rhylanor, and of course Vincennes/Vincennes, with Kubishush, Ashasi and Thingen fighting over niche markets. These rivalries never took on tradewar proportions, as it would have prompted an Imperial intervention harmful to business. But there was petty intrigue, nasty pricing and industrial espionage galore. 

Regional unity became a casualty of their bickering, as it was apt to paralyse the region even in times of crisis. This backbiting was one of the major reasons for both the Industrial Development Program, and the choice of Mora as a TL16 world. 

^^^^

Minotaur

A corporation that is engaged in a mazelike, often times multinational, network of companies of dubious or illegal ownership. The imposition of the Quarantine, and Regency crackdowns on corporate behavior winked at during the Imperial period compelled many corps to skirt the law any way they could. Most Minotaurs are controlled by Imperial corps with a previous history of widespread misbehavior. Most of these companies are circular, meaning that they control or are controlled by, subsidiaries that appear to be completely seperate, but eventually reconverge somewhere in the chain of interlocking ownership. Some companies even "zigzag", with the lines of ownership jumping national borders several times. Regency laws outlaw the most obvious kinds of Minotaurs, but the need for export/import trade has limited legislation against the more nimble or creative operators. Notorious offenders included Sternmetal, SuSAG, Blackhawk Enterprises, SpinDevCorp/Venturprise, and Arkesh/Interglobal. 

^^^^

Narval Controversy

The destruction, by Imperial naval forces, of the civilian settlements on this world (SM 0805) during the Third Frontier War. Narval had been captured by Zhodani forces during the Second Frontier War, but managed to retain its Imperial culture, and was friendly to its new overlords. The world's strategic location made it a threat to Imperial facilities and shipping in Jewell and Vilis, and its cooperative spirit was anathema to Imperial prejudice against the Zhodani. An Imperial Naval strike force simply entered the system, defeated the local system defense, took up position in orbit, and annihilated the civilian populace with mass drivers. This atrocity boomeranged by outraging other Imperial culture worlds in the disputed regions, and was instrumental in the creation of the large demilitarised zone that has been emplaced in Vilis and Querion since the end of that war. Narval's surviving Imperial communities have reconciled with their cousins in the Regency since the Collapse, and the world is heavily visited by traders from both states. 

^^^^

Obeyery

Amphibian alien species native to Stave/Cronor (SM 0710). The Obeyery are 400 kilogram bipeds with long lizard like bodies. Their culture is very reminiscent of the Vargr: a constant struggle for dominance among individuals. Unlike the Vargr, though, the Obeyery recognise the need for semi-permanent leadership. The world has been unified under a "lord protector" since late in the Antebellum period. The Obeyery can be overbearing to offworld visitors, but they are quite friendly and accepting to such contact. Unfortunately they have a low level of technological development, and few resources to trade beyond their excellent Stave "Corn". 

^^^^

Old Frontier

The former military frontier of the Domain of Deneb. With peace between the Regency and the Zhodani Consulate, the paranoia and fear that typified the people of this region, and their foolhardy defiance, cooled down considerably. The local military concentrations were built down and transferred to the Rampart to deter Virus. Because of their low tech levels, and a number of amenable worlds, they became migration destinations for Regency citizens desiring to be left alone by the wider universe, an attitude that meshed with the locals own laissez-faire mentality. 

The exposed frontier, the presence of an implacable enemy, and the depressed economic conditions of the region forced self-reliance on the part of the locals, and a deep admiration for collective institutions, particulary the military. The admiration for the military is evident in the lavish praise for military heros and military valor. Most significant families have at least one member in military service at any given time. Memorials to military feats and heros dominate public spaces. Education is often slanted towards discipline and sacrifice, and encourages volunteerism and public service in students. 

The ongoing Zhodani Exodus has rekindled the old fears, and in some cases the worst angels of the regions character. A debate between duty and old animosity has emerged within some parts of Frontier society, and sometimes it is resolved with acts of bloodshed. 

^^^^

Otarri

Primitive amphibian alien species native to Faldor/Plankwell. Known as "Lung Fish" to human neighbors. The Otarri live in the massive swamps of the main continent, and are ruled by a queen installed for life. Despite these matriarchal tendencies, local culture is very egalitarian. Most offworld contact comes from Regency traders on Flammarion or Bowman. 

^^^^

Research Station Delta

Imperial research facility on Retinae/Querion. The facility was first built in 687 with the sole purpose of studying the Tashaki and their strange ecology. Delta consists of a specially shielded dome structure, about 500 kilometers from the Tashaki "capitol." Nuclear dampers are built into its environment plant to prevent contamination from the highly radioactive atmosphere (which is mostly oxygen with high amounts of Radon and other radioactive gases). Imperial Army engineers excavated an extensive system of subterranean warrens under the facility, and structurally it can withstand a direct hit from a low yield tactical nuclear weapon or a major earthquake. 

^^^^

Research Station Eta

Imperial research facility on Judice/Plankwell (SM 1337). Judice has a corrosive atmosphere with high amounts of nitric acid. Despite this hellish environment, extremely hardy life has begun evolving in the worlds nitric acid "seas". Since 1103 Eta has studied these lifeforms, and subsequent surveys showed that the local biosphere was even more significant in extent than previously thought. Eta has been run by Kaldi Research since 1155, and has been expanded to do research in severe environment conditions, and fluidic research biochemistry. 

^^^^

Saurians

Sentient, reptilian society native to Saurus/Vilis. The slow, stone age Saurians were overlooked by the IISS exploratory teams when the world was first explored. Because of its T-Prime status, the world was opened to outside colonisation with great fanfare. And then the colonists discovered the truth about their neighbors. "A day late, a credit short" the Imperial government could do little beyond sending observers to prevent exploitation of the suprisingly gentle creatures. In the centuries since colonisation, the Saurians have shown a penchance for copying human culture, having formed simple communities copied upon the human settlements. Many Saurians serve in the local defense forces, and were instrumental in beating back a Sword World incursion in 1132. 

^^^^

Spinward Hub

The convergence of the main branches of the Spinward Main in Lunion subsector. Since the Collapse, the term has been expanded to refer to Lunion's crucial importance as a convergence point for Regency finance, trade and cultural exchange. Economic development and corporate relocation has made the local high population worlds the information nerve center, not only for the Regency, but for a major part of the Spinward States in general. 

The Hub is not heavily industrialised in comparison with other regions, but the majority of its industries are specialised to support this flow of exchange and trade. Transportation, software and a variety of service industries are dominant here, and seventy percent of the Regency's banks, insurance houses, and investment brokerages are headquarted on Lunion and Strouden alone. 

^^^^

Stave Corn

Grain crop native to Stave/Cronor. Stave Corn has virtually all of the major nutrients required by carbon based lifeforms, and it is raised by the native Obeyery race as their main export. Stave Corn is not like normal grain, but is actually a bittersweet legumaceous pod that is usually roasted before processing. It is very popular with human vegetarians, but is more commonly ground up and fermented to create "Stave Whisky", a very mild yet richly alcoholic beverage. 

^^^^

Stronghold

Name given to the rapidly developing subsectors of Mora, Gulf/Deneb, Zeng/Deneb, Deneb/Deneb, Vestus/Reft, Macon/Reft, the rimward portions of Starlane and Vincennes subsectors, and coreward Trin's Shroud. 

Despite the Rape of Trin, the Rift was never a primary vector for vampire fleets. Even the most organised of Puppeteer and Empire Builder viruses showed great reluctance to cross the rift, and only a few extraordinary groupings actually attempted the feat. This gave the Rift the fewest, and yet the largest and most deadly, battles of any Regency frontier. The relative safety of this region, combined with the immediate effects of the ID program, had enormous benefits for local worlds. Largely a stagnant backwater of decrepit industrial worlds, and their equally desperate smaller neighbors, during the antebellum period, the flow of investment and technical assistance created an economic boom that hasn't shown letup since it started. 

While most were late-starters in terms of technological ability, the massive populations of several worlds, and their attainment of at least TL 12-14 allows for massive quantitative production. But the full benefits of the IDP have not yet been realised. By 1215, it is estimated that Beaxon, Askigaak, Deneb, Fornice and Pikha will all attain TL15, making the region the premier industrial center of the Regency. Moreover, strong local reinvestment in neighboring worlds is beginning to bear fruit as a general increase across the the region. And two of its worlds are "banging on the door" relative to TL-16 (Dekha and Lintl). 

The region originally recieved its name for its close proximity to the Great Rift. But it is aptly named for another reason: distance from potential or existing crises. While some Aslan Ihatei reached Vestus and Gulf, for the most part the region has been free of the major crises that have disrupted other regions like the Rampart and the Thinrim. Here is the only place in the Regency one actually feels safe, with none of the militant paranoia of the frontiers or the festering resentments and unfinished business of the Thinrim or Midway. 

^^^^

Tashaki

Mysterious alien species indigenous to Retinae/Querion. A silicon based humanoid species whose life cycle depends, as does all life on Retinae, upon heavy amounts of radioactive materials in the atmosphere. The entire ecology is alien to this world, and appears to have been transplanted here around 600,000 years ago. The Tashaki do not seem to have any individual characteristics, though no evidence exists for a hive mind or telepathic linkage. The Tashaki communicate through phosphorescent "eyes" on their bodies (which is where the world takes its name) that can be translated by computer software. 

^^^^

Tethmari

Ammonia breathing, vegetarian alien species native to Gyomar/Cronor (SM 0108). The Tethmari are squat creatures supported on three five toed limbs. The front limb contains their visual, audio and olfactory senses, and their digestive organs. Tethmari society is divided into three sexes: male, female and Enabler. Enablers are rare but vital individuals that handle leadership roles in their society. All members of Tethmari society are given their place and lifelong caste at the whims of Enablers. The Tethmari are very friendly to offworld contact, but the cold, dense ammonia atmosphere of their homeworld tends to discourage visitation. 

^^^^

Thanber Consolidated Properties

Otherwise known by its initials, TCP. Enigmatic and controversial corporation owned by the world government of Thanber (SM 0717). Allegations have been raised that the company is a Minotaur with ties to several shady firms across the Spinward/Coreward corner of the Marches, including several tied into the Tukera family. Thanber had strong ties with Tukera before the Civil War, and was practically controlled by that now defunct megacorporation. While the world had taken a beating from the company's pullout and subsequent demise, it has survived economically with the assistance of former company employees, and subsidiaries spun off during its pullout. Regency MoJ and other government agencies have kept TCP under close but discrete scrutiny for years, even though the company appears to be rather clean itself. 

^^^^

Thinrim

Once a melancholy backwater of mediocre industrial worlds catering to trade with the Aslan, the Thinrim has risen to being second only to the Stronghold in population and technology. This despite the heavy Ihatei invasions that overran much of it in the period of 1119-1122. The fait accompli arrangements of the Spinward Accords left many of its worlds in the control of Aslan clans, most of whom imposed their own culture upon the local populations, and were ambivalent in serving the Regency. Despite the simmering tensions with the Aslan, the common cause of Virus, and the need for a secure rear area away from the trailing frontier, compelled the local populations to adopt a "live-and-let-live" attitude of balancing their grievances against grim necessity. This has not prevented occasional confrontations on mixed population worlds, and it does little for fait accompli worlds. 

Thinrim worlds show the evidence of past crises. During the Ihatei invasions, large numbers of people were uprooted, and replaced by Aslan. When the Collapse occured, most of these people returned, joined by refugees and economic settlers in the billions. Most worlds, then, are a mixture of dilapidated older settlements, and a crazy-quilt of Collapse era temporary settlements that look as if they were erected yesterday, yet contain the bulk of the population. In spite of this, or perhaps because of it, the dividing line between ghettos and upscale neighborhoods are obliterated, and human and Aslan communities are rather well integrated on liberated worlds. 

Many of the Thinrim's goods are destined for the Aslan Remnants and its maintenance of the Riftspan Quarantine. There is much irony in this. The Aslan Rift Territories contain only a few industrial worlds, and the Collapse left the region with little technological depth compared to the Regency. Despite the Ihatei invasions, the fait accompli settlements, and the accomodations of the Spinward Accords, the Regency now holds the advantage. Industrial dependence became an effective means of controlling Aslan aggression, and deterring material support to fait accompli rulers.

Tucked in like a Tukera

Colloquial phrase common to the old Imperium. Literally means to enjoy a position of power and wealth based upon nepotism and cronyism. The phrase is inspired by the antebellum exploits of the wide ranging Tukera family, owners of the Tukera Megacorporation. 

^^^^

Tukera Family

In the Domain of Deneb, the family was represented by the Marquis of Aramis in the Spinward Marches, and the Duke of Star Lane in Deneb. The Civil War and Collapse took a very heavy toll of both the BTC Tukera's. The company withdrew from the Domain in 1124, leaving the local branches stranded. The Collapse destroyed the company proper, leaving the survivors with a mountain of debts and handfuls of now worthless stock certificates. But to their great credit, and political skill, the family has managed to survive its adversities, and the Aramis Tukeras have even regained most of their prosperity. 

^^^^

Ursty

Sentient, octopoid species native to Yurst/Regina. The Ursty are 80 kilogram omnivores native to Yursts shallow oceans, possessing a "bioculutre" technology that manipulates other oceanic species to their bidding. While they were full Imperial citizens, Yurst's high chlorine content atmosphere discouraged offworld contact beyond a few visiting academics and government researchers. The Ursty possess seven tentacles, six for use and one for mating display, and three compound eyes. 

^^^^

Xebec

Shipbuilder headquartered on Lanth. Xebec produces mostly 1,000 to 10,000 ton modular "barges" for the Spinward Marches starship market, but also produces a number of smaller budget ships for the independent market. Most of its ships are produced on Lanth proper, but the company has recently purchased plant on Karin/Five Sisters and Mongo/Jewell. Xebec is most famous for its namesake class, a unique "telescoping" 150-330 ton modular merchant that can be expanded to accomodate various cargo sizes without compromising its profitability.

Battle of Ashes

Last futile military campaign by the Assemblage of 1116, that took place in 1133-1135. The bloody standoff between the Domain of Deneb and the Assemblage had left Deneb's coreward subsectors shattered, and by the time of the Collapse an uneasy stalemate prevailed between the two warring sides. Through emissaries, Norris secured a ceasefire in 1131 that temporarily ended the fighting and permitting a reshuffling of fleet elements to trailing. The following year the new Regency ceded occupied worlds to their Vargr warlords, and incorporated them into its protective custody. Intimidated by the bold Regency actions but happy with the recognition of their claims, several corsair lords transferred their allegiance, even if reluctantly, from the Assemblage to the Regency. 

Assemblage leader Arruna Kosghaele Zal acquiesced to these developments publicly, but inwardly refused to accept the frustration of his ambitions. Zal quietly mustered as many military and corsair units he could afford, and assembled them into a fleet at Ongon/Dhukhaegz (Tuglikki 0737) in 1133. The fleet entered the Regency at El D'Nah/Pretoria (Deneb 0502) and quickly overpowered the light RQS contingent guarding the system. The fleet then made its way down the Borderline, overrunning the Regency naval base at Kirklend/Pretoria. Most 61st Fleet units in the region had been drawn away by the Abandonment further to trailing, and the remaining squadrons, while technologically superior, were vastly outnumbered. Zal's forces paused briefly at Kirklend, sending out light raider units throughout Pretoria and Lamas to disrupt communications. His strategy was to soften up the 194th Fleet by scattering its units in pursuit of these light units, and then charging into the subsector at the head of his heavy units. Unfortunately for Zal, notice of the tragic results of the Sword World Landgrab did not reach him in time. Instead his heavy units waited at Kirklend throughout 1134 while the Regency mustered reinforcements at Pretoria. In 1135 Zal and his troops finally moved down towards the Safe, only to be intercepted by these reinforcements at Ash (Deneb 0504). In the resulting battle the disbelieving Zal refused to acknowledge that he had miscalculated, and committed to a battle that destroyed nearly ninety percent of his forces. Zal and his three eldest children were killed in the subsequent melee. The remainder of the Assemblage fleet attempted another invasion of the Regency later in the year, this time through Lamas Subsector, but were crushed for good at Lome (Deneb 1306). 

While the outcome of the battle was never in doubt after Zal's failure to exploit his earlier gains, the victory was an important morale booster for the fledgling Regency forces, and were immortalised as the the Battle of Ashes. Zal himself has become an Ozymandias-like figure in Regency media and historical depiction, a despot who wagered the fate of his entire nation on a single bet, and lost everything. After the Battle of Ashes, surviving Vargr states reaffirmed their loyalty to the Spinward States Accords, and subsequently corsair raiding of the Regency almost ceased entirely.

Assemblage of 1116

Oppurtunistic state founded in 1116 upon recieving notification of Strephon's assassination. The state was founded by the popular dictator of Ngorsraek (Tuglikki 1937), Arruna Kosghaele Zal. Through not able to defeat the Domain of Deneb fleet en masse, a joint mustering of independent corsairs and planetary navies inflicted major damage upon many Denebian worlds in subsectors adjacent to the Assemblage, and caused major evacuations even before the arrival of Virus. The worst of this damage came in the coreward extents of Lamas and Pretoria subsectors, and many of the casualties were civilians killed in raids on commerce and ground installations. 

So great was the hatred of Regency citizens and local military cadres for the Assemblage, that in the wake of the Battle of Ashes no surrender of any Assemblage affiliated units was ever accepted. Instead nearly every unit that attempted encountered was massacred, with no special distinction made between legitimate units or corsairs. Many Assemblage civilians were also massacred by enraged planetary militias on worlds where Vargr forces did not have an advantage or control. 

A significant portion of the Assemblage's forces already present in the DoD's outer marches managed to stave off further assualts, and regrouped surviving stragglers. So poisonous is the relationship between locals and these holdouts that the Regency must manage strong naval patrols in coreward Deneb for the purpose of buffering the two communities. Information coming through Gehenna has indicated that several worlds in the former Assemblage are on the verge of making a recovery from Virus, and this has further inflamed tensions in the coreward Frontier. 

^^^^

Borlund Abandonment

The massive demographic collapse of Borlund/Lamas (Deneb 1406) in the wake of the Abandonment. Borlund's high population was the result of insane Imperial development policies that turned this marginal world into a major manufacturer of Pre-Stellar level goods for export into the Vargr Extents. With the release of Virus, and the prior demise of its markets due to Vargr raiding, the world had become a major liability to the Regency, who placed it into the Frontier. Between 1132 and the present, Borelund has lost some 50 billion of its people. Only half of this number has been due to offworld emigration, as the movement of so many people was simply impossible even with the utilization of troop transports. 

Instead the world's younger citizens were induced to emigrate by the planetary government and their elders, leaving behind an aging population that has diminished through natural death. Borlund is now a world of graying elderly people, supported largely by the remittances they recieve from their descendants living elsewhere in the Regency. The local industries have largely ground to a halt, and most jobs are filled either by simple automation systems, virus resistant robots, or by offworld guest workers, many of whom are Vargr immigrants. The presence of the latter necessitates a major RQS contingent as a deterrence to Pack activities on this vulnerable world. Borlund is generally not thought of by people in the Safe as a world worth visiting, a sad casualty of necessity.

Countinghouse

High security storage facility located in a cave complex on Karst/Namidshur (Deneb 1814). It is located offshore in an old salt mine, and its location makes it nearly inaccessible to the surface. The facility is owned by the Karst government, and run by a public corporation. The extent and layout of the facility are classified, but it is rumored to be extremely large. Nearly everything imaginable has been stored in its depths at one time or another. The facility administrators do not discriminate between its customers, and its clientele ranges from the Regency government storing important documents to retirees hoping to preserve family heirlooms. A nearby private C-class starport is the sole means of outside access, as no roads lead to the facility, and the Karst COAAC interdicts the local airspace. The facility itself is sealed from the mainland by flooded access tunnels, and only submersible vehicles operated by the Countinghouse administration are permitted to enter its confines at any time.

Regency Frontier Fleets 


1. 55th Fleet (Roughriders): Deneb Sector "Swing Fleet" headquartered at Marnie's World/Sabine. The 55th is most famous for its timely arrival in Pretoria subsector during the Battle of Ashes. Its forces reinforced the overstretched 194th and 61st fleets in their battle against invading forces of the Assemblage of 1116, and the combined force crushed the invaders decisively. The ragged, improvised manner in which the 55th made its way to the battlefront, and the expert way it regrouped and turned out for battle, earned it its name. 


2. 61st Fleet (Ericson's Rocs): Fleet responsible for defense of RQD 3. Headquartered at Uramid/Antra. Fleet name comes from its early Collapse period commander, Admiral Arabella von Ericson, a Fifth Frontier War veteran and hero. Ericson commanded a starmerc organisation of the same name during the Civil War period, that was inducted into the 61st and became a nucleus of resistance against Virus intrusion from the Vargr Extents. The fleets length of continous service is one of the longest in the Regency, having faced Vargr during the entire Civil War period, and then fighting a mixture of Vargr corsairs and Vampire Fleets during the Dreamtime. And because of the variety of enemies it has had to face, its casualty rate is the highest in the Regency Navy. 


3. 125th Fleet (Karmic Yeomanry): Namidshur subsector Fleet. Headquatered at Shinorasus/Namidshur. The 125th backs up the 183rd in the Frontier, and its forces have been called upon many times to assist their neighbors in fighting Vampire incursions. Namidshur was a largely backwater subsector previous to the Civil War and Virus, and its infrastructure and local institutions were less than able in absorbing large numbers of Human and Vargr refugees. The 125th has played a major role in providing shelter and security for both refugees and their adopted homeworlds, creating a strong bond between local civilian communities and the fleets personnel. In return for this strong support, 125th units are often fanatical in their defense of local worlds against pirates and Vampire Ships. 


4. 183rd Fleet (Gatekeepers): Fleet responsible for defense of RQD 4. Headquartered at Usani/Usani. No other fleet has seen as much action or combat than the 183rd. With a wide area of responsibility facing the main body of the former Imperium and much of the Vargr Extents, the fleet is subjected to frequent Vampire incursions. At the peak of the Quarantine War, fleet units were averaging two or three battles a week against against ships ranging from errant small craft to infected former Imperial Dreadnoughts. Now battles may occur once or twice a year for most line units, but the fleet remains a cherry posting for ambitious and aggressive naval personnel. Demand for Frontier duty is high enough normally, but the 183rd's G-4 office only has enough billets for about 1 out of every 10 applications it receives, and its selectivity makes the fleet one of the most skilled and elite in the Regency. 


5. 194th Fleet (Iron Guard): Pretoria subsector fleet. The 194th is less of a battle unit than an internal peacekeeper. Pretoria has a long history of political friction, most famously the Rachelean Revolts. Previous to the Civil War, fleet units were in control of the subsector capitol itself in the Revolts wake, and were instrumental in calming and reconciling the Vilani majority of the subsector with Solomani or Mixed immigrants. This experience was highly useful in the face of large Vargr refugee flows that flooded the subsector in the period of 1136-1148. While the Vargr have proven more difficult to deal with than the Vilani, the 194th's large number of Civil Affairs units and long experience in low intensity policing have kept open warfare from breaking out between struggling factions and Pack Dens. 


6. 315th Fleet (First to Fight): Lamas subsector fleet. Headquartered at Lamas/Lamas. Previously known as the 1st Fleet during the Fifth Frontier War, before postwar reorganisation cost it its designation, though it lives on in the fleets nickname. Though in theory the 315th defends the small sliver of Lamas that is included in the Safe, in practice its units are frequently rotated out to the Frontier for exercises or missions in support of the 61st. Occasionally some of its units have been assigned to the 183rd, and many of its squadrons have Wildside combat experience. It has an unhealthy hatred of Vargr criminal and corsair elements, and its units have been unnecessarily harsh in their prosecution of these groups.

^^^^
 
Haggard Station

Forward RISS scout base found on Haggard/Antra (Deneb 2409). The scout base was one of the few in the Third Imperium to be constructed completely underground, as it was originally an underground containment facility used by the Exploratory Office for samples it had found during its wanderings. When the Collapse hit, the base was abandoned by the Regency, and its personnel were evacuated safeside. After the Rape of Trin, however, an RQS survey team discovered that the base was virtually intact, despite several attempted Vampire intrusions. With the Regency reexpanding its surveillance net back into trailing Deneb, intelligence gathering and liason with local free traders were seen as very important, and the base was reoccupied in 1141. 

Haggard Station is less a military outpost than a trade and contact station, though a full battalion of marines defend it full time. Most people Passing through the Frontier use the world as a transit point, and a number of free traders come here to trade useful salvage or information with the scouts for needed manufactured goods or maintenance. Scouts and Quarantine personnel use its secure containment facilities to examine either salvage reclaimed in the wilds, or to test captured or recovered technology for Virus infection. It is fitted with medical clinics and schools that attract free trader patronage, and many trader collectives take advantage of the incentives offered by base security. 

^^^^

Ingram Services

Regency's largest private security firm. Ingram is a wholly owned subsidiary of JAX/TCP, the Regency branch of Thanber Consolidated Properties. Ingram provides security guards both living and cybernetic, passive and active security systems, and security consultation for a number of public, commercial and private clients across the Regency. The company was once a wholly owned branch of Tukera Lines Vemene intelligence agency, but was spun off to TCP in the 1120s. The company once included many of Tukera's armed patrol and military ships, but these were requistioned by the Regency in 1132. In the last fifty years its services have expanded to include bodyguards, escort and courier services, and even runs private prisons for subsector and planetary governments. 

^^^^

Passing

Colloquial term for people who travel regularly through the Quarantine between the Safe and the Wilds. As difficult as it may sound to inhabitants of the Safe, it is only illegal to make an unregulated or uninspected crossing of the Frontier from the Wilds. No ship or person may cross into the Regency Safe without subjecting themselves to inspection by the Quarantine Service. 

But there is no law to prevent commercial or diplomatic contact across the Frontier. A multitude of technical and economic reasons exist to prevent either from developing on a large scale, but it does infrequently occur, especially with Free Trader Collectives friendly to the Regency. In the early years of the Quarantine people who actually took their chances outside of the Safe were considered to be suicidal, but nowadays when it happens it garners more curiosity than disgust. RQS and military regulations prevent personnel and ships from indulging in this trade, and Free Traders are guaranteed a monopoly on what commerce does exist. Most of this is a kind of beads and trinkets trade, or exists mostly at the official level with Traders passing along valuable salvage in exchange for ship maintenance and high value manufactured goods. Even more significant is the passage of persons, mostly children of Free Traders and even a few local warlords dispatched to the Safe for education and rearing, many of whom return to the Wilds and often agitate for the opening of the Frontier as adults. 

^^^^

Pretorian Way

J-1 route linking 16 worlds from Lewis/Aramis to Gyrfal/Lamas. The Way was of marginal importance in the antebellum period, as few of its worlds were that important. Since the Collapse the rebirth of Pretoria, the flowering of Urnas, and the growth of the Quarantine have made it a high capacity route. Many of its worlds possess substantial Vargr populations, and several are fait accompli. Conflicts between Vargr Pack factions, and tensions between human and Vargr communities tend to drag down local commerce at times. (Pete's Note: This was omitted from the earlier Astrography Data.) 

^^^^

Rachelean Revolts

The bloody race riots that tore apart Pretoria/Pretoria and several neighboring worlds during the early 1000s. The rioters were mostly Vilani, rebelling against the Pro-Solomani practices of the sector duke, whose family had long repressed them and outlawed Vilani culture and language. These riots culminated in the creation of the Rachele Society, and the destruction of the scout base, and subsequent killing of 26,000 civilians, on nearby Saki (Deneb 0306) 

Pretoria, along with many other worlds in Deneb, was heavily settled by Vilani in the first century of the Third Imperium. Later colonisation waves of Solomani and mixed blood humans eventually assimilated into these communities, and the racial distinction faded away on most worlds. But on Pretoria the Vilani were able to preserve their cultural heritage almost intact, as their urban communities were tightly organised around small neighborhood sized collectives. This led to some tension with immigrating Solomani, but in nearly every case these were assimilated into Pretorian culture without much trouble. 

But in the wake of Arbellatra Alkhalikoii's ascension, a number of troublesome Solomani nobles were relocated or exiled by the new Empress to the far frontiers of the empire for a variety of reasons. And to Pretoria she assigned a former Daibei sector noble family, of pureblooded Solomani descent, known as the Carles-Davies. It was to have disastrous consequences. The Carles-Davies were sympathetic to the Solomani movement, and their forced relocation to Pretoria had the effect of hardening their fervor. In their new position as Duke of Pretoria, they cracked down hard on "Vilani intransigence." The Vilani language was banned in favor or Anglic, Vilani merchants and businesses were subject to harassment and onerous laws and regulations, and the authority of the neighborhood councils were curtailed in favor of a bureaucratic government that favored the Duke or Duchess. The advent of the Psionic Suppressions were used as an excuse to practically ban all forms of Vilani cultural and political expression, and Pretoria became a police state patrolled by the Carles-Davies huscarles' and hated Uniformity Police. 

Because of this pressure, traditional education and authority had to go underground. Educators formed secret shadow academies where students were taught the Vilani language and culture, in small dormitories and cloistered classrooms. Attempts to ferret out these "school-rings" with random searches and expedient mass arrests further radicalised the population, and many school-rings became training grounds for terrorists and resistance cells. One ring produced Zidi Rachele, an extreme Vilani supremacist who called for the extermination of non-Vilani races in favor of a racially pure "Fourth Imperium." Despite the obvious insanity of his message, the fact that many local Pretorians sided with his and his terrorist society was an indication of how desperate the population had become. 

The revolt coincided with the end of the Solomani Rim War, and in its wake an Imperial intervention seized Pretoria, and the Carles-Davies were liquidated by the newly appointed Sector Duke. Pretoria was subject to a hundred and sixty years of military occupation, which was only ended by the Representational Reforms.

Syr Darya Crisis of 1156

Viral invasion of Syr Darya/Antra in 1156. A very large fleet of mixed Imperial and Vargr military ships, controlled by a pair of Alliance Builder strain Viruses, penetrated the Regency frontier shortly after Holiday, and seized Syr Darya in a lightning attack. The fleet grounded a massive 100,000 ton bulk carrier they had somehow managed to secure, and began to dismantle it and the large base facilities it was carrying, burying the pieces in a large underground warren near the downport. The first Regency counterattack was beaten back with heavy losses, and it took a full planetary invasion, complete with large ground force contingents, before the Vampires were defeated and the world was reclaimed. The attack weakened the Frontier border enough to permit another Vampire Hive to invade Antra, in what is now known as the War of the Antra Pocket. 

^^^^

United Followers of Augurgh

Former Vargr interstellar state located in the lower trailing-rimward corner of Tuglikki sector. Augurgh was a very charismatic Vargr of vision, who convinced millions of Vargr of the merits of his vision for a technological paradise. Unfortunately his state proved just as susceptible to the Oekhsos tirades of the antebellum period, and a number of associated corsair bands invaded parts of Deneb sector in 1116. Augurgh was not as Anti-Imperial as his neighbors, but had to play the game or face attack from other "spacewolves." Augurgh died a premature death under suspicious circumstances in 1138, and his followers were snuffed out by Virus in 1143.

The Antra Pocket War

"Insurgency" war fought over several worlds of RQD 3 between the Regency and a large coalition of Puppeteer viruses in the period of 1160-1165. Three Puppeteer fleets took over the world of Tuedhikhuez/Antra (Deneb 1905) in 1159, and began infiltrating the Regency Frontier near Dunant/Antra (Deneb 1806). This was accomplished through the audacious use of Vargr guerillas formerly associated with a God Virus that had been taken over by one of the fleets. The guerillas were supported by well balanced units of warships that took up position at strategic locations in a system. Under the protective screen of orbital firepower, the guerillas seized strategic and easily defended targets, in many cases abandoned or partially abandoned communities in the outbacks of several Frontier worlds. 

Because Regency forces in the Frontier were organised to repel massed fleet units, and not more mobile raiders, the response of its fleets were initially clumsy and hamhanded. The raiders would attack small targets, induce the less mobile Regency forces to counterattack, and then would melt away after inflicting heavy losses. The viral strategy was rather simple: to wear down the Frontier defenses through attrition until its forces could effect a full breakthrough. A break in the fighting in 1162 gave Regency forces the time to reorganise the local 61st Fleet into smaller task forces, and shift from a reactive defense posture to actively seeking out the main Virus Hive and its base. Defense squadrons contained further attacks, and dedicated Pathfinder units tracked the retreating Virus fleets into the Wilds. Finally in 1165 the 61st, reinforced by the 315th and 55th Fleets, cornered and destroyed the main hive at Tuedhikhuez. The patient tactics of the Antra viruses signalled a shift in Viral organisation and sophistication, and reinforced the reorganisation of Regency naval doctrine.

Wilderness Ranger Corps

The conservation and wilderness policing arm of the Ministry of the Interior. They were formerly a part of the Imperial Ministry of Conservation, and were merged with the Ministry of Colonisation to help form the new agency. The WRC is the main policing service encountered in Regency reserves, colonial worlds, and wilderness preserves. The Rangers are the primary police force, outside of the major communities, on Marastan/Glisten for example. Rangers are also entrusted with the protection, preservation and operation of the Regency's various Ancient sites since 1133. Since the Abandonment, most worlds in the coreward Frontier are policed by selected units of Rangers in cooperation with local RQS cadres. In many cases Rangers patrol abandoned communities, preventing takeovers by Vargr or Viral squatters. 

^^^^

Askigaak Corridor

J-1 route connecting 14 worlds in Star Lane, Vincennes and even Gulf Subsectors (Qevar). The Corridor is entirely dominated by the huge demographic weight of Askigaak, to the point that neighboring worlds refer to themselves as either its "suburbs" or the "countryside." 

^^^^

Atsah Subsector

Region of Trailing Deneb contained within the Wilds. Formerly settled and controlled by the Third Imperium. Like its neighbor Million Subsector, Atsah was underdeveloped, as most of its economy supported the Midway trade routes moving out of Corridor to the far corners of the Domain of Deneb. Economically the subsector was dominated by the high population world of Atadl (Deneb 3015), but the majority of its worlds were lightly populated worlds hosting a mixture of agricultural and trade related industries. 

The subsector was severely damaged by the attacks of the Dzaargh Federate, which captured several worlds in 1116, and which helped to severe the Domain of Deneb's ties to the rest of the Third Imperium. Several worlds were granted independence by the DoD in an effort to create a buffer region with the Vargr states of Corridor. The Abandonment depleted the subsector during the Collapse, and few of its worlds are that heavily populated. While many systems have fallen under primitive strongman dominated feudal states, sporadic contact with the Regency military and RQS has kept cultural ties strong, and planners expect little resistance in the subsector to resurgent repopulation. 

^^^^

Backwash

The cluster of economic and cultural activity, existent within an adjacent developed region, that coincides with expansion into any frontier or backwater. Nine-tenths of all colonisation is a cavalcade of merchants, transit workers, bureuacrats and hangers-on, that subsist upon the trade generated by a region undergoing colonial development. Because of the dangers and economic expense of colonisation, most people directly involved will not risk the dangers or hardship, preferring to stay based within a safe previously developed region, and wait for the pioneers to tame the colony worlds for their safe eventual settlement. Regency policymakers and demographic planners are already predicting a similar cycle in trailing portions of Deneb, and some signs are already extant in Usani. 

^^^^

Bon Voyage

Percieved trade and shipping route comprising several worlds running up the Regency Frontier from Pikha/Zeng, past Deneb/Usani, and into Atsah Subsector. The choice of this route is based upon the enormous economic output of the Stronghold, and the simple linear path that goods to and from this region to the expanding Frontier. Most notable in these calculations have the worlds of Gampin/Atsah (Deneb 2820) and Khishuda/Atsah (Deneb 2918) 

^^^^

Bon Voyage Boom

Outrageous increase in land prices on worlds in the Bon Voyage region. Many habitable worlds with small populations have been deluged by land speculators since the announcement of the Frontiers' opening. Most notable of these are Avernus/Usani (Deneb 2027) and Azed Bek/Usani (Deneb 2323). 

^^^^

Borderline

J-1 route connecting 14 worlds in Pretoria Subsector, running from Marz (Deneb 0201) through the Regency Safe, then the Frontier, and finally terminating at the Wilds world of Taa (Deneb 0701). This region has always been lightly developed, and the Collapse did not help economies shattered by the Civil War and Vargr raiding. Because of its overlap into both the Wilds and the Safe, military presence is very pronounced and welcomed. In many cases the military and supporting the Quarantine has become the main source of income for these worlds, and local political groups have been vehemently opposed to opening up the Regency Frontier in the past, for fear of losing this income. 

^^^^

Deneb Cluster

J-1 cluster of 24 worlds in Usani and Vincennes Subsector. Physically and economically dominated by the demographic bulk of Deneb itself, few of its worlds are well developed. The Abandonment caused significant population migration to many smaller habitable worlds in the cluster, most notably Amshal (Deneb 1926). It is anticpated that the reopening of the Regency Frontier will cause a new demographic shock in the form of so called backwash settlement, on several worlds. Demographers are predicting a population boom of twenty billion people in Usani alone. The trailing "arm" of the cluster is part of the romantically named Bon Voyage. 

^^^^

Denebian Rampart

Romantic name given to the Regency Frontier, or adjacent regions of the safe, in Pretoria, Lamas, Antra and Namidshur Subsector. In these regions normal economic activity has all but ceased due to the overriding threat of Virus, and the looming dominance of the military and quarantine forces. 

^^^^

Gauntlet

Codename for those systems in the Wilds within 4 parsecs of the Regency Frontier. The Gauntlet is not intended to act as a primary defense line, but as an additional barrier to detect and slow incoming threats. All of these systems contain forward emplaced listening posts and surveillance ships, with fast long range scouts located at the 100 diameter line for early warning of the Frontier should a Vampire Fleet move into the region. Those worlds with a short supply of refueling points, like one or two gas giants, often have battle rider squadrons hidden in ambush points for weeks at a time. All Regency Naval and Quarantine vessels operating in the region serve under relaxed rules of engagement. Since the Frontier's opening, the Regency Frontier Fleets have posted additional forces and patrols in the area. Some temporary facilities have been replaced with permanent base structures, hinting at a possible move of naval units. 

^^^^

Million Subsector

Region of Trailing Deneb contained within the Wilds. Formerly settled and controlled by the Third Imperium. Million's tenous position on the border with the Vargr and mediocre resource base did little to attract trade during the Antebellum period, and most of its worlds were entrepots of trade and intrigue between Imperial culture humans and insurgent Vargr traders and travellers. The news of Strephons' assassination caused two Vargr powers, the United Followers of Augurgh and the Dzaargh Federate, to invade the trailing and coreward portions of the subsector. Unlike Atsah, Millions was retained by the DoD during the entire Civil War period, only to Abandon it in the face of Virus and the Collapse. Today Million is a crazy-quilt of human survivors and Vargr refugees; Regency planners anticipate some problems with assimilating the region because of its fractious and scattered political factions. 

^^^^

Pioneers

First wave colonists. Professional and semi-professional workers skilled in taming, developing and building up a previously unclaimed world for further development by later colonial waves. In antebellum times Pioneer corporations and collectives worked under contract for the Imperial Ministry of Colonisation. 

The Regency has fewer such personnel, and mostly within far spinward portions of Spinward Hinters. As such the resettlement of Corridor Sector and Trailing Deneb will probably resemble the colonisation of North America and Australia: waves of transient colonists will open up worlds through military action, tame it enough that Backwash settlers are compelled to immigrate, and then the transients will move to another unclaimed region and start the process all over again. 

^^^^

Plant "N#"

Regency military or government owned munition, manufacturing or shipyard facilities. All of these plants are exclusively intended for forces enlisted against Virus, or enforcing the Quarantine. Most of these facilities are capable of TL-15 manufacture, and a growing number are TL-16. Nearly all of these plants are located in systems of TL-14 to 16 capability, though a few are found just about everywhere. Most of the plants are operated, under contract, by various planetary and private corporate entities according to Regency standards and policies. In many cases scientific and technical personnel come into contact with cutting edge research and development, and most plants "parole" outdated or unnecessary equipment and materials to nearby worlds; this has aided significantly the Regency's efforts at technological dispersal and development. 

^^^^

Sabinar Main

J-1 main connecting 42 worlds in Sabine and Inar Subsectors. Sabinar was the main conduit of the great Midway trade coming down through Deneb to spinward portions of the Spinward Marches. Consequently several of its high population worlds are rather well developed, including Magash and Starn. Many were and still are the lights of the sector's economy, even if they still bicker and compete vociferously against each other. 

^^^^

Spinward Main

The great J-1 main that connects most of the Spinward Marches. The Main actually starts in Star Lane/Deneb at Mater Nova (Deneb 0221) and Adapam (Deneb 0224). Those worlds of spinward Star Lane contained in the Main are considered to be culturally part of the Marches rather than Deneb. 

^^^^

Zeng Connector

J-1 cluster connecting 21 worlds in Zeng/Deneb and Macon/Reft. Because of previous economic underdevelopment, most worlds have independent economies that permit them to contain the economic and political struggles of Lilad (Deneb 1135) and Fessenden (Deneb 1440). Several water worlds, notably Third Mu (Deneb 1137), Ushashin (Deneb 1138) and Dawn (Deneb 1336) have recently come under scrutiny by dissident groups on Lilad, as possible worlds of settlement or refuge, in anticipation of intensified fighting on their homeworld. 

^^^^

Adamantium LRC

The Regency's second largest corporation. Adamantium, along with LSP and Morning-STR, is one of the Regency's three "universal" products manufacturers, and a member of the so called Big Five. It primarily concentrates in transportation equipment, starships, power generation equipment, and an array of automation and industrial technologies. The company was founded on Mora in 1133 by industrialist Hoseki Eikawa, who bought up the scattered Denebian divisions of now defunct Imperial megacorps, and cobbled together a fully functioning company. Like its bombastic founder, Adamantium is an aggressive company, and a constant thorn to the older LSP. Adamantium is one of the largest R&D underwriters in the Regency. 

The company's ships, robots and transportation equipment is well built and of very good reputation. It has shipyards at Rhylanor/Rhylanor, Mire/Daryen, Karin/Five Sisters, Maitz and Mora/Mora, Ara Pacis and Magash/Sabine (flagship yard), Starn/Inar (Plant 62), Vincennes and Dekha/Vincennes, Tobia/Tobia (Plant 88), and Lintl/Vestus.

AI Race

Competition between Regency government and private consortiums to be the first to develop a man-made Artificial Intelligence. The contest has existed since 1152, and massive sums of money and time have been spent by interested parties to accomplish this nebulous goal. But the payoff is quite serious, the creation of machine intelligences that are not associated with Virus, and are resistant if not immune to viral infection. A prize of ten million credits, plus royalties of ten percent was posted by the Regency government as an incentive. In recent years the contest has come down to a three way struggle between small firms/public research teams on Mora, Dekha and Vincennes. Allegations of sabotage, bribery and shady dealings with the Flame of Purity movement have plagued the projects and their associated personnel for years, and they have gotten worse as the finish line has come into sight. Current estimates say that a full functioning AI will be achieved by 1218. 

^^^^

The Big Five

The five largest Regency corporations: Adamantium, General Products, Grand Design, Ling Stanard, and Morning-STR. All of these companies are generally concerned with the design, development, manufacture and distribution of the material goods that connect and comfort Regency society. 

^^^^

Deneb Sector Shipping Companies

In addition to Transstar, several relatively smaller companies also ply Deneb's busy trade lines. These include (in diminishing size): 


1. Aster Nova LRC: The Regency's second largest shipper. The company is also a larger passenger carrier than Transstar, an inexplicable anomaly. 


2. Lodestar LRC: Large passenger hauler and bulk carrier. The company used to be quite active in Trojan Reach and parts of the Marches, until it was busted by MoJ for repeated violations of the Quarantine codes. 


3. Ohtori LRC: Private spinoff of Transstar. In recent years the company has taken over many of TS's less profitable lines. In the last year it has quietly taken over several of Transstar's more profitable regions and facilities in several interior regions, as TS ships have disappeared from active commercial service. Ohtori is Japanese for "Phoenix." 


4. Sovereign Lines LRC: Transport subsidiary of McClellan Factors. 


5. Sky River LRC: Formerly part of Ginga Transport of the Marches, which was forced by it shareholders to divest itself of its Deneb Sector holdings after several major scandals threatened to undermine its profitability. 


6. Wonderworkers LRC: See Wonderworkers.

Geek

Modern term for a person who spends an inordinate period of time working or mastering a field of study, hobby or artform. As opposed to a workaholic, geeks are perpetually concerned with actual accomplishments. There is no industry in the Regency today that does not trace its existence to the tireless efforts of technicians and researchers toiling in windowless labs and basements. 

^^^^

Heartland

Theory of geographic development. First proposed after Terra's Second World War by a Solomani writer named Mackinder. The theory purports that a nations economic wealth is concentrated in its interior, and therefore development will pattern itself away around areas of mineral and biological wealth. Subsequent research has shown that this is only true of a small number of nations and regions producing primary goods, that in industrial and post-industrial societies development follows the Rimland pattern. 

^^^^

Invisible Hand

Misinterpreted reference in Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations", the authoritative book on the existence and importance of free markets. The Invisible Hand only appears once in a later chapter towards the end of that venerable text, and its refers not to the limitless perfection of an unfettered market, but to a perfected human morality minus greed, cruelty and license and other market impediments. As with so many Enlightenment thinkers, Smith is simply arguing a preference, in this case for free markets, but is implying pessimism about its doctrinal realisation. Yet, as with many parts of Karl Marx's Das Capital, this statement has been repeated countless times in history by pundits and polemicists who ignore or forget the original context. 

^^^^

King Jupiter

Regency's largest retail chain and warehousing firm. Founded in 1141 by Huang Mu-Xing, who named the company after a pun on his own name. King Jupiter started as a department store on Beaxon/Gulf, and was renowned for its low discount prices, ample product lines and ease of shopping and ordering. But the company really took off through aggressive marketing and expansion into grocery (Huang's Club) and small retail (Olympic) fields in Deneb and Reft Sectors during the 1150s and 60s. The company has begun experimenting with producing its own "nanofacturing" technology, whereby its retail store and much of its inventory can be reproduced by a single small unit that can be leased or rented out to interested consumers for their own whim or disposal, and the company would make a profit off of sells of data packages and refills of material tanks. The company's cartoonish logo of Jupiter king of the gods is almost as familiar in Deneb and Reft as Astroburgers silver 'A' on an Imperial sunburst, a trend accelerated by a crossmarketing alliance between the two companies. KJ is given to outrageous marketing stunts, a habit encouraged by the self-promoting antics of its famous founder.

Regency Labor Shortage

The increasing division of services and labor along lines of comparative advantage has dramatically altered the economic power of so called "unskilled" laborers. The segmentation of the Regency economy has diminished the available labor pools at the same time that increasing specialised technology requires hard working and dedicated professionals. Across a major section of service industries, from food service to child care, it has become increasingly difficult in recent years to fill these positions with existing labor markets. This trend has accelerated the buying power and wage increases of these markets, though not prosperity, to the level of a decent living wage. The opening of the Frontier is expected to intensify this situation, as the higher returns of colonial development attracts many younger workers out of the Regency Safe.

Lensman LRC

Small shipbuilding company based upon Deneb/Usani. Lensman had been an antebellum specialty builder of yachts and high performance racing craft, but the advent of the Civil War forced it to expand into military and paramilitary markets. Lacking expertise in manufacturing large military starships, it tried its luck at building SDBs and fighters. But the company really found its niche at the beginning of the Collapse, when it began building cheap conversion kits for constructing planetoid SDBs and Monitors. The company has nearly exclusive control over the innermost belt of nearby Eshamlil/Usani (Deneb 1826), from which it culls suitable rocks, which are then outfitted with parts manufactured on Deneb. Or the company just ships the conversion kit to a frontier system, which slaps it on a planetoid obtained locally. The construction of these planetoid fleets were a timely and affordable addition to local defense forces during the early years of the Collapse, and remain an important part of Frontier defense fleets.

Ling Standard Products LRC

Former Imperial Megacorp. In antebellum times the company produced everything short of the kitchen sink. Compared to most of its Imperial era brethren, LSP was quiet and modest, and it success had less to do with chicanery and scheming than with solid corporate policies and management. But the desolation of the Imperial environment has given way to the extremely fluid and competitive markets of the Regency, and LSP has had to struggle to maintain its dominance in the face of new corporate competition. That it is still the largest company in the Regency is testament to its management and corporate vision, and it remains the benchmark by which all corporate activity is compared. 

LSP is still a primarily general manufacturer, though its starships and vehicles are the most noticeable of its massive product line. It maintains its headquarters at Lunion/Lunion, and regional headquarters at Tobia/Tobia and Dekha/Vincennes. It has shipyards at Rhylanor/Rhylanor, Lunion and Strouden/Lunion (both the largest private yards in the Marches), Pallique and Mora/Mora, Ffudn and Glisten/Glisten, Edenelt/Trin's Shroud, Tobia, Seleen/Sabine, Starn/Inar (largest private yard in the Regency), Isurkun/Star Lane, Dekha (Plant 12) and HRD/Vincennes, Qevar/Gulf and Pikha/Zeng.

LRC

Abbreviation for Limited Regency Corporation. Replaces the older LIC and AG suffixes. All Regency corporations that are held over from the Third Imperium were required to undergo rechartering and licensing in the 1130s, and no Imperial-era license is currently honored by the Corporate Licensing Board. 

^^^^

Morning-STR LRC

The Regency's third largest company, and one of the so called Big Five. Morning-STR is headquartered and intimately linked with the fortunes with Vincennes. The company was founded in 1079 by Albana Morning, a female industrialist/scientist prominent in the local electronic industry. For most of the antebellum period, the company was a fair sized manufacturing firm that produced many of the goods marketed by Vincennes famous "G" corporation. Because of the limited markets for its high-tech products, the company was confined to Vincennes and its immediate vicinity. But the Post-Collapse need for TL-16 technicians and scientists to assist the Regency government and military permitted the company to finally escape the bounds of its homeworld, and it has grown mainly through contracts in assisting the construction of the Regency's emerging TL-16 research and development infrastructure. 

The company "backpedaled" many of its TL-16 products to lower tech levels, and aggressively marketed them to other worlds and on the general market to obtain a market share in anticipation of the lifting of the TL-15 cap. Like LSP and Adamantium, Morning-STR is a general manufacturer, though its product line is a full quantum leap ahead of its rivals in many cases. The company makes nearly as much money assisting other worlds in working their own way to the TL-15/16 boundary, and it is thought that when the cap is lifted, the company will probably overshoot its rivals into markets where it holds an overwhelming technical and industrial lead. The company is not content to rest on its laurels in the face of intensifying competition, and it is a dangerous rival to any would be TL-16 manufacturer. 

Morning-STR has shipyards on, Efate/Regina (Plant 60) Mora and Fornice/Mora, Magash/Sabine, Askigaak(the military's Plant 30), Norg and Imone/Star Lane, Preslin and Beaxon/Gulf (Plant 33; these are military only facilities and therefore not reflected in UPP), Vincennes, Taburi Nen and Dekha/Vincennes, Lilad, Depot Beta and Pikha/Zeng, Neumann/Gazulin, and Tobia/Tobia. Morning-STR produces mostly TL-15 ships, and a growing TL-16 product line for government and large commercial buyers.

Multiworld Cartels

Large Imperial era companies that operated on more than one world in a variety of developing industries. These companies are a residue of the expansion driven nature of the antebellum Imperial economy. As befits its name, the Third Imperium was an empire, and it followed an imperial pattern of economic development. The multiworld cartels would spearhead a drive into a previously underdeveloped region of the Imperium, generally through primary industries. Because of the wealth to be gained through untapped natural resources, competition was fierce, which made the acquisition and processing of these resources more efficient. Eventually the construction of industrial base would occur, and the megacorps would dry up the the local markets and push out the smaller cartels into some other area of the Frontier to repeat the the process. 

Since the Collapse many cartels have had to adjust to closed markets and a different pattern of development. Most now dominate the less well developed regions and worlds of the Regency's frontiers through diversified services like transport and manufacturing, or run profitable businesses in areas prohibitive in cost and expense for the larger Big Five companies or their contemporaries. Rather than being the first wave of imperial pillage, multiworlds are now concerned with development of remote backwater worlds for their eventual integration into the emerging TL-15 to 16 mainstream. In many cases, however, cartels seem to have a fairly liberal interpretation of the term development, and some are little better than their antebellum ancestors. With the opening of the Frontier, signs exist that they might revert back into Imperial habits, a development that might be unavoidable for the next few years: 

Multiworld Cartel Companies: 
Blackhawk  Barracai Technum  
Diaspora  GaE  
Interglobal  JAX/TCP  
McClellan Factors  SpinDev/Ventureprise  

^^^^

National Industries

Public industries owned or maintained by communal, planetary or local governments for the benefit of the entire population. With the increasingly network nature of Regency corporations, and intensifying competition between urban centers, national cartels are the primary means of economic exchange between larger government and economic entities, and local communities. 

National companies generally are the main providers of labor, supporting infrastructure and power for the industrial operations provided by the Regency government, and the Big Five, Residual or Multiworld companies. About ninety percent of all workers in the Regency that work for the bodies listed above actually draw their pay and benefits from their local governments or contractor. Contrary to what might be expected, these bodies do not supplant or remove labor agitation, and Regency laws strike a reasonable balance between workers and employers. 

^^^^

Post-Affluence

Term in reference to the emergence of the Regency middle class. The accumulation of equity and property by a broad spectrum of the population tends to encourage attitudes of pragmatism rather than polemical and divisive ideological politics. While the middle class is prosperous, that prosperity depends in large part upon overriding communal trends such as economic efficiency, public peace, maintainment of public education and other civil amenities that can only be maintained by government action. The term "middle" class can therefore refer to both its mid position between extremes of wealth and poverty, and between the traditional liberal and conservative opposition. 

^^^^

Primary

Adjective referring to industries or markets that are organised around the search, harvest and processing of natural resources such as ores, farmland, lumber, animal products, petrochemicals, raw fossil or solar energy, and precious metals and gems. 

^^^^

Rimland

Theory of Geographic development. In opposition to Heartland theory, Rimland proposes that a nations economic development will advance from primary to secondary and tertiary goods, which requires the convenient location of urban centers and production facilities to facilitate cheap and timely transportation, and the shortest possible distance between all sources of materials and markets. Consequently most urban development will occur along the margins of a large country, such as coastlines or national boundaries. 

The Third Imperium showed a mixed structure between both Rimland and Heartland development, as many interior sectors like Diaspora and Core were lightly populated compared to Vland and Solomani Rim; but at the same time inefficient development policies and unrealisable expectations encouraged growth in regions like Massilia and Ilelish. 

In many ways the Imperial Civil War was a battle of economic expectations versus the realities of the integrated Imperial market; there existed no logical economic reason why Ilelish and other rebellious interior sectors should be as highly developed as rim sectors. And yet previous industrial development, subsidised by the Throne and its megacorp viceroys encouraged the accumulation of primary industries and fleetingly profitable secondary industries in these areas. The breakdown in cultural cohesion and fragmentation of the Imperium was essentially an attempt to regenerate frontiers that would be adavantageous to these leftover regions. In hindsight, however, the loss of the common Imperial market cost these areas more than fragmentation gained, a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

Schunaman und Sohn AG ( SusAG ), LRC

Former Imperial megacorp. SusAG was founded around 500 in the Imperial Core, and made its fortune off of the manufacture and sell of psi-drugs. When these became illegal with the Psi Suppressions, the company branched out into the manufacture of chemicals and pharmaceuticals. While highly profitable, and possessing a stellar reputation for product quality, the company was dogged by Imperial authorities over allegations of abuse and corruption on a scale worse than any other Imperial era Megacorp. The surviving Post-Collapse part of SusAG has an equally spectacled past, with run ins with Regency and Spinward Hinter governments over smuggling, production of contraband and illegal materials, and often boorish behavior by its management and private security services. In recent decades the company has been hurt by increasing competition; a failure to adjust to new technology and fund basic R&D has caused its profits and market share to slip, and its dominance has been eclipsed by rivals like General Mechanics and Sternmetal. The company maintains its headquarters at Glisten, and regional headquarters at Pretoria/Pretoria, Pikha/Zeng and Neumann/Gazulin.

Secondary

Adjective referring to industries or markets that are organised around the conversion of primary energy and materials into manufactured goods.

Tertiary

Adjective referring to industries or markets that are organised around the provision of services such as sales, bureaucracy, medical and child care, customer service and marketing.

The Triangle of Enterprise

All societies are suspended to some degree between three different economically productive organisations: the entrepeneurial, the intellectual and the organisational. Each organisation possesses different structures, economic goals, and function. None of these three are dominant, nor contain the absolute truth, but provide together all of the main ideologies and truisms of a functioning and advancing society. 

1. Entrepeneurial: Concerned with the creation and fostering of private businesses and their supporting networks. Such worlds are disdainful of the bureaucratic and economic hand-wringing of more comfortable and mature worlds; behind every great fortune is a great effort that requires the dismantlement of older established orders protected by bureaucratic rules slanted more towards protecting the status quo, than in delivering the fair and equitable society that they so often claim. A good example of an entrepeneurial world is Beaxon/Gulf, whose traditionally hidebound bureaucratic government has given up more and more authority to the vibrant business and intellectual community that has destroyed and remade its economy to great success in the last twenty years. 


2. Intellectual: Concerned with the creation of a better future. Few human accomplishments are gained through random accident, the majority requires deliberate thought and experimentation. These are worlds dominated by universities, research labs and so called "technosalons." Compared to entrepeneurial worlds, these worlds are less interested in the tangible yet ephemeral requirements of profit, and are can be more experimental and flexible in their political and economic development. Creation is attended by destruction, and messy nature of science and technological development are unsupportable by either the market or the government, and must exist in a temporal and spatial zone of its own, according to its own pace. Examples include Vincennes/Vincennes and Magash/Sabine. 


3. Organisational: Concerned with the maintainment of order and public virtue. Despite the disdain of the entrepeneurial, bureaucracy is the third oldest profession for a reason: the abstract world of information requires human attention, and it is ill served by the mood swings of the market, or the creative anarchy of the university. Organisational worlds have highly organised workforces, orderly and safe streets, well maintained infrastructure, and the trains run reasonably on time. Here the concern has less to do with making money or rolling back the frontiers of knowledge than in providing an environment in which the material and spiritual glue of society can be fostered and flourish without undue disruption. Organisation worlds include places like Ashasi/Inar and Deneb/Deneb. 
Turnstile Economy: The complementary market structure of the Stronghold. The offcenter location of that region, abutting the Great Rift, puts it in close proximity to both the Regency Frontier with the Wilds, and the border with the Aslan Hierate. Producers therefore have a choice of two markets, and can either shift production and supply networks depending upon conditions in either, or can specialise to a highly efficient degree. In both cases, the Stronghold is a strong and stable supplier of vital industrial goods required by defense forces in both regions in maintaining the Quarantine, and in the future, any reexpansion into the Wilds.

Visible Hand

The manifestation, through the governments execution of laws and standards, of the morality of a community in reaction to market forces. Contrary to the doctrine (as opposed to the idea) of a self correcting market, or a market that is benign in its correction, a community and its represenative authority (government) may act pragmatically in compensating or counteracting the impersonal forces of commerce through simple and modest actions. Phrase coined by Solomani social scientist Theodore Lowi.

Wonderworkers LRC

Surviving remnant of the Gvaenoks interface shipping line, a Vargr company that once served all of Gvurrdon and most of Tuglikki Sectors. The company survived the arrival of Virus and the establishment of the Quarantine, but failed to survive an internal schism that wrent apart the company in 1145. The sole Regency based section of the company went independent, and serves the coreward edge of the Regency, with heavy concentration in Deneb along the frontier. The company employs both Vargr and human workers without discrimination, and retains a fleet of scheduled j-3 traders complimented by roving j-2 free traders. 

^^^^

Avalon

Rumored Regency naval base complex located in the Great Rift. Based upon analysis of shipping patterns through trailing Deneb sector, experts think that it is located near the boundary between Corridor and Reft sectors. But in many ways Avalon is more reflective of the tensions and fears of Post-Collapse society. Much like the legendary Area 51 of ancient Terra, ROMs Freedonia 86 facility, and many Imperial research stations, Avalon is a void into which the popular imagination projects its hopes, dreams and fears. 

Most popular stories claim that, much like its legendary antecedent, Avalon is a repository of a massive force of Imperial era troops, possibly the remnants of Strephon's loyal military units, being kept in cold sleep until the Regency has a need for them in the reclamation of the former Imperium. More fanciful fiction has even gone so far as to proclaim that Strephon himself sleeps alongside his Faithful, and will lead them into battle himself to purge his suffering empire of its demons, and restore liberty to his people. The power of these "sleeping king" myths in the popular mind should not be underestimated, as it has been a rallying point for reformers and revolutionaries for decades. The RQS and Regency military have been guilty in the past of invoking the story's mythic qualities for recruitment and motivational purposes. While popular credulity in the story has died down in the last quarter century, it remains a popular touchstone, symbolising the slumbering potential of the Regency, now stirring to awakeness. 

^^^^

Diasporan Legate

Regency's recolonisation "czar", otherwise known as the Regency Frontier Office. The RFO is considered to be a temporary affair until the reestablishment of the Ministry of Colonisation. The Legate is little more than an office with a minimal staff so far, though a supporting bureaucracy is slowly being cobbled together. The Legate will primarily be a judicial and legal enforcement body overseeing disputes and infractions by colonists moving into the former Imperial Wilds. 

^^^^

Eternal Legion

Regency's largest veterans group. The Legion is a powerful lobbying and mutual aid group founded in the early years of the 1130s to render aid and give a political voice, to the increasing numbers of military veterans created by the Imperial Civil War and the Virus War. The Eternal Legion has "postings" in most major Regency communities, and even a few among those Vargr and Minor Spinward worlds that have large contingents of troops stationed alongside Regency forces preserving the Quarantine. 

The Legion is both a base for networking and communal gathering of military veterans, an advocacy group for veteran affairs and government services, and a political pressure group known for its conservative principles. While not strongly supportive of Imperial- era relics like the nobility or Imperial power priveleges, it counts itself a strong partisan of the restoration of the Iridium Throne, and at times seems ambivalent about the merit of democratic reform. In many ways the organisation has an excessive sense of its own self-importance, a consequence of its naming of First Regent Norris as the organisations first "Commander" in 1144. While Norris declined the offer, the nobility in which he did was percieved as poignant self sacrifice by some within the organisation, and it is often strident in its support and loyalty to the Aledon-Alkhaliikoi family, and its eventual restoration to the Throne on Capitol. 

The Legion has been shameless in its perpetuation of the Avalon myth, and takes its name and many of its traditions from its inspiration. The membership body of the Legion is known simply as the Fellowship, and individual members are formally Loyal Friends of the Flame, or just Friends. It takes a stylised version of the Arthurian Roundtable as seen from above, covered with a circle of swords pointing towards the center. A number of reactionary or radical movements have founded refuge in some of its posts, namely the Flame of Purity "liberation" movement of the Frontier. 

^^^^

Interstellar Chamber of Commerce

Ancient business organisation first founded on Terra before the invention of jump drive. The ICC is a fellowship of businesses and corporations, from the local to the interstellar levels, that acts as a forum for business related information and advocacy. The ICC was refounded by a number of Denebian businessmen in 1125 to assist smaller planetary and subsector businesses hurt by the withdrawal and contraction of the DoD's economy in the wake of the Imperial Civil War. 

While the Chamber is often criticised by many holdover anti-corporate factions mindful of Imperial era abuses, it is many ways a major improvement. For the Chamber's primary mission since the Collapse has been to foster the development of business in all sizes on as many worlds as possible. In the face of Virus and the war effort against it, the most efficient defense is to deepen the level of commerce and provide a necessary tax and logistical base both to fight and survive it. And the attendant levelling of former Imperial era Megacorps and new emerging smaller businesses is a happy and welcome side effect. The Chamber often acts as a private mediator of business disputes, quite an improvement over the trade wars of the past.

^^^^

Jump Conveyor

A huge starship built to carry massive loads. Conveyors are usually intended for colonisation purposes, and usually displace more than a million tons. They are almost always built without manuever drives, to increase the amount of internal space and cut down on unnecessary engineering crews. As such a conveyor relies upon carried craft for refueling and defense. In naval parlance these huge immobil craft are referred to as "mother pigs" or "beached whales". Jump Conveyors are the primary vessels of choice for the upcoming Askigaak Abandonment, and experience in this operation is seen as a building block for reexpansion into the former Imperium.

Lynx's Crown

Regency/Spinward States equivalent to the ancient Nobel Prize. The highest science award presented in Charted Space. The Crown is awarded by the Society of Lynx's chapter on Starn after awarding of the Starn Gold Medal is completed. The Crown is awarded to only a single individual or groups of individuals for an outstanding accomplishment in the field of science. 

^^^^

Medal of Conspicuous Gallantry

The second highest award for military bravery and valor. The MCG is awarded for distinguished acts of battlefield valor, though usually ones that do not incur as much risk or danger as is incurred for the SEH. 

^^^^

Meritorious Conduct Under Fire Citation

Lowest award for bravery awarded in the antebellum Imperial military. Otherwise known as the "Good Attendance Award" among Regency military personnel. The medal was largely given out for political and morale reasons as much as for genuine battlefield valor. Since the Collapse it has lapsed into obscurity. 

^^^^

New Prometheans

Popular name for the larger than life personalities that dominated the Regency politically and economically in the period 1140-1177. 

^^^^

Point-to-Point Race

Regency spanning regatta and starship "race" that takes place every four years. The race is a direct descendant of the antebellum Spinward Point-to-Point that briefly flourished before the Civil War. While its existence seems extravagant, the race is often used by starship designers and manufacturers as a proving ground for new technologies and a showcase of Regency technical and military power. Each race has the same objectives: contestants must reach every designated checkpoint, where they turn in an encoded "baton" to the local officials in exchange for the baton confirming their arrival for the next checkpoint. The contestant that passes through each checkpoint and arrives at the finish point wins. All Point-to-Points start and finish at the same system; since 1172 this has been Neumann/Gazulin. The last race, held in 1200, was won by a research team from Guushigaar University on Deneb, though it barely beat the Regency Navy Four team and their ship by just twenty two minutes. 

^^^^

Regency Jubilee

The year of 1182 was the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Regency. True to Norris and the spirit he founded, it commemorated the accomplishments of the nation as a whole, and not the reign of him or his heirs. Despite the continuing state of military readiness, nearly every world in the Regency was able to spare some expense at celebrating five decades of continued survival. The six months leading up to the massive Jubilee celebrations on Mora were marked by smaller ones on subsector capitals and prominent high population worlds. 

In many ways the Jubilee was a turning point in the mentality of most Regency citizens. The fact that they had survived fifty years in spite of the Viral threat created a brief period of introspection, and then a growing reaction against both Imperial era institutions and the current Regency security state. The period following the Jubilee was one of stirring passions and enterprise, as entrepenuers and reformers rode a surge of popular anger and disillusionment into a series of political and economic revolutions more decisive in impact than the abortive period following the initial announcement of the Representational Reforms. The 1180s are seen as a decadent period in Regency history, and one of confusion over the precise course of the future. But it was also a time when the customary attitudes and institutions of the Post-Collapse period began to lose their potency, and had to defend themselves against a rising tide of dissent.

^^^^

Regency Orders of Knighthood

The First Regent retained the archducal precedent of making knights unmodified into the Post-Collapse era, and this habit was not ended by the Representational Awards. The First Regent consolidated the various orders, and created several combined orders to expand upon his conception of public service. The old racial and special orders were abolished, though Regency Aslan and Vargr have rarely complained about their representation in the new fellowships. The Regency's orders of knighthood are: 


1. Order of Sword and Starship: Awarded to distinguished military and quarantine personnel. Based in part on the old Order of Starship and Crown. Abbreviation: OSS 


2. Order of High Tower: Conferred upon distinguished business, cultural and political leaders. The emphasis is upon public contribution, not economic success or monetary wealth. Therefore a nun from a poor section of Adabicci, who has tirelessly raised public conciousness about Vargr orphans is more likely to be inducted than your average corporate executive. Abbreviation: OHT 


3. Order of the Sacred Flame: The highest honor that can be conferred upon a citizen of the Regency. Only the most influential and distinguished members of the Regency, whether military or civilian, ever recieve the status of a "Flame Knight", and doing so is a recognition of lifetime achievement. Unlike other orders, knighthood is conferred through a council of all Regents, and is bestowed in the form of a medal, the Sacred Flame Medallion. Abbreviation: OSF 


4. Honorable Order of the Arrow: In antebellum times the Arrow was conferred upon Imperial space explorers; Norris wisely increased its scope to include anyone who advances the frontiers of knowledge, whether explorers, inventors or scientists. Winners of the Lynx's Crown are almost always inducted into the order within a few years of their reception of that award. Abbreviation: HOA 
Regents Day: Remembrance and celebration holiday celebrated on the 81st day of the year, Imperial calendar. The exact timing of this holiday is somewhat controversial, as it seems to coincide more with ancient Solomani tradition than with any particular anniversary within Regency history. The holiday had been championed by King Jupiter founder Huang Mu-Xing, and the 81st day of the year coincides with ancient Chinese concepts about the significance of the king. Nevertheless the holiday is a popular one, and its tone, pokmp and celebrance recalls traditional independence day celebrations. 

^^^^

Rotary Interstellar

Interstellar organisation modeled upon an ancient Solomani organisation. The Rotary Interstellar is a humanitarian society founded upon the ideal of public service for the betterment of the society. The service organises chapters on individual worlds, and where local conditions permit, in individual communities on those worlds. RI has chapters across the Regency, in many parts of the Spinward Hinters, and even a few brave clubs in the Zhodani Consulate and Vargr Splinters. 

Unlike many groups espousing similar goals, Rotary is more of a networking of different interests than a cohesive bureaucratic organisation in its own right. It recruits heavily among normal citizens, business executives, and draws strong interest from corporate and institutional parties across the Spinward States. Its goals are general, and attuned to the community or world level. It has four general goals: 

FIRST: The development of acquaintance as an opportunity for service; 

SECOND: High ethical standards in business and professions, the recognition of the worthiness of all useful occupations, the acceptance of all sentients in all occupations as contributors to the common good, and the dignifying of each Rotarian's occupation as an opportunity to serve society; 

THIRD: The application of the ideal of service in each Rotarian's personal, business, and community life; 

FOURTH: The advancement of interstellar understanding, goodwill, and peace through a interstellar fellowship of business and professional persons united in the ideal of service. 

(The previous four sections are adapted from material on Rotary's main webpage: www.rotary.org) 

The Rotary has a number of ongoing projects. Most notable are the current relief operations within Zhodani refugee camps, an effort that has won praise from all corners of the Regency for its organisation, effectiveness and unjudgemental approach. It has been a strong advocate of the psionic reforms, and has fostered psionic education through the overt funding of new Psionic Institutes across the Regency. 

Starburst of Extreme Heroism: Highest medal rewarded for bravery in combat to be awarded in the Third Imperium and the Regency. The SEH is only awarded to individuals who show extraordinary accomplishment on the battlefield in spite of heavy risk to life and limb, heavy resistance, or injury or possibility of death. Needless to say, the SEH is usually awarded posthumously. 

^^^^

Starn Gold Medal

Modern day equivalent to the ancient Nobel Prize. The Gold Medal is presented by the Starn Branch of the Society of Lynxs to worthy individuals or research fellowships in several categories: physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology, medicine, history and philosophy, economics, mathematics and information theory. 

^^^^

Swords and Diamonds: Two additions to existing Regency awards for gallantry, indicating multiple awards of the same medal or citation. The Swords indicates that an award had been bestowed twice, and Diamonds indicate three times. Swords and Diamonds are usually found for lesser medals of gallantry; A SEH with Swords is extremely rare, and one with Diamonds is unheard of.

AAB
Argushiigi Admegulasha Bilanidin

The Argushiigi Admegulasha Bilanidin, which in Vilani literally means the "Vilani Repository of All Knowledge", is a major scientific institution on Vland. The extensive AAB facilities include a vast museum, a library, and several research centres and publishing houses. Not only does AAB collect samples, specimens, and recorded materials from all over explored space , but it also publishes an abridged 15 holocrystal encyclopedia set of its extensive data files. Known simply as "The Encyclopedia", the set contains the equivalent of 7500 extensively illustrated volumes, yet it can easily fit into a large pocket.

The Argushiigi Admegulasha Bilanidin (also called the AAB) is perhaps the most respected scientific and research body in known space.Located in the city of Ishimaga on Vland ( Vland / Vland 1717), the extensive AAB facilities include a vast museum, a library, and several research centres and publishing houses. The vast stockpile of information to be found here is far beyond that available anywhere else in the Imperium, and thus the AAB has become a sort of 'clearing house' for new inventions and patents.

Not only does the AAB collect samples, specimens and recorded materials from all over collected space, it also publishes an abridged 15-holocrystal encyclopedia set of its extensive data files. Known simply as "The Encyclopedia", the set contains the equivalent of 7500 fully illustrated volumes, yet it can easily fit into a large pocket.

Although the AAB sponsors very few outside research programs, it maintains a vast network of laboratories on Vland.

Due to the often conservative nature of the AAB, researchers who find employment here are likely to be investigating already existing phenomena, rather than breaking new scientific ground. Its giant database is freely available to scholars and researchers who come to Vland.

The personnel and resources of the AAB also form the backbone of the faculty and learning materials of Kasiiga University.

Abyss

Engulfing most of the Lanth subsector and extending into the Vilis and Lunion subsectors, the Abyss is a large area of low stellar density in the midst of the Spinward Marches. It has been the site of several notable ship disappearances over the last half-millenium, and has built up a substantial amount of lore associated with the vanished vessels.

Only seven systems lie within the Abyss' boundaries.

Adair

Archduke of Sol, Grand Admiral of the Rim. Adair's great grandmother held the post of Grand Admiral of the Rim during the Solomani Rim War, and was rewarded with the Archduchy.

Addaxur

Intelligent minor race of six-legged carnivores from a high gravity world 40 parsecs from Zhdant ( Gavel / Zhdant 2719). This world is in Subsector-G of Tienspevnekr sector.

The Addaxur had established an empire of 37 worlds, with communications maintained by sublight ships, by the time the Zhodani discovered them in -5110. The Zhodani observed the fringes of the empire for about ten years before making open contact in -5120. Carefully planned overtures established friendly relations and reserved 10 of the Addaxur's 37 worlds for the Addaxur without restricting Zhodani expansion.

Air/Raft
Air Raft

Also known as a flier, the air/raft relies on solid-state anti-grav modules for lift and propulsion. Four independent, individually replaceable modules insure a maximum of safety, in that each provides one-quarter of the vehicle's total lift. A standard air/raft masses about 4 tons, and can carry a payload of about 4 tons, including the pilot and 3 passengers. Cruising speed is usually 100 kph, with unlimited range and endurance. The normal air/raft is open-topped and subject to the effects of weather and climate.

The major drawbacks to the air/raft are its low load capacity, its relatively slow speed, and its susceptibility to weather (both the negative effects of bad weather on passengers and the slowing effects of high winds and buffeting).

Most air/rafts are capable of reaching orbit (occupants must wear vacc suits) but the trip will take several (6 to 8) hours. Also, most can be overloaded with passengers (a maximum of 8 can fit with minimal comfort) so long as the tonnage maximum is not exceeded.

Al Morai

Sector-wide merchant line based on Mora ( Mora / Spinward Marches 3124). Established in 120 as a local transport company serving systems within ten parsecs of its base, the company soon expanded to handle freight and passengers travelling from the Darrian and Sword Worlds subsectors to the Imperium.

During the widespread explorations of the Marches in the third century (201 to 300), Al Morai established an Exploration Division to supplement its cargo carriers. That division discovered, claimed, and developed two worlds: Windsor ( Glisten / Spinward Marches 1935) and Shirene ( Lunion / Spinward Marches 2125).

Windsor was later sold to Ling Standard Products; Shirene was retained as a base of operations and a source of merchant goods.

Organisation
Al Morai has three operating divisions: the Transport Division, the Markets Division, and the Exploration Division.

The Transport Division operates Al Moral's fleet of thirty cargo carriers, providing both passenger and freight service.

The Markets Division maintains Al Morai's starport facilities along its routes. In addition to providing ticket facilities and freight terminals, it operates as a merchant, buying local goods for export and importing needed materials for sale.

The Exploration Division originally surveyed star systems, but as new star systems became unavailable, its purpose shifted to surface exploration of Shirene . The Exploration Division currently operates a large geological survey team, with prospecting detachments throughout Shirene .

Origins of the Company
Al Morai was originally organized under the business codes of Mora. The peculiar corporations of that world grew out of frontier partnerships where the partners contributed capital to build the business, but also relied on their membership to provide themselves with jobs.

When the company was organized, 100 shares of stock were issued. Most of the partners received one share; a few received more than one. Each share of stock entitled the owner to a portion of the profits of the company, and provided the right to a job (of certain salary levels and responsibilities) with the company. Those with more than one share used the extras to provide jobs for family members.

Stock Ownership and Employment
The original organization served well enough in Al Morai's formative years, but as the company grew, the stock ownership system changed. Stock splits and stock dividends increased the number of shares outstanding. Eventually, the company by-laws were amended to allow the employment rights to be stripped (separated) from the common shares and sold or traded separately. Employees could sell their stock while retaining their right to their job; heirs of former employees could sell their job rights to Job seekers while retaining their common stock.

Eventually, the current system evolved. Common shares indicate ownership of the company and provide dividends when the company is profitable. There are currently 200 million common shares outstanding; single shares sell for between Cr500 and Cr8OO on the open market. Shares currently pay a dividend of Cr10 per share annually.

Employment shares provide the right to employment with the company. For a variety of reasons, one share no longer entitles the owner to one job. Instead, employees must own one employment share for each credit of monthly salary. A starship pilot entitled to Cr6,000 per month must own 6,000 employment shares. A pilot normally eligible for a 10% skill bonus because he or she has Pilot-2 would also have to have an additional 600 employment shares before the additional salary could be paid. The true value of employment shares is that they can be used to achieve higher than normal salaries. An excess of up to 50% of normal salary can be drawn if enough employment shares are owned. A pilot normally entitled to a salary of Cr6,600 could actually draw a salary of Cr9,900 if he or she held 9,900 employment shares. Excess salary comes from company profits and is paid only if the company is profitable; when the company is losing money, only normal salary is paid.

Holders of employment shares have an absolute right to a job of the appropriate normal salary as long as they own the employment shares.

Employment shares sell for Cr12 each. Employees often purchase their employment shares through a time purchase plan administered through the company.

Alternative Employment
Al Morai does not have enough employment shares outstanding to completely fill its labor needs. Consequently, the company acquires much of its labor through independent contractors. Ship crews are exclusively hired from employment share holders. Market Division employees on worlds other than Mora and Shirene are often independent contractors; they are paid ordinary salaries and can be hired and fired as required.

Employment share employees of Al Moral refer to contract employees as children or kids.

Route Service
Al Morai maintains interstellar service to the capitals of Imperial subsectors in the Spinward Marches , and to Imperial worlds along the trade routes which connect them. Service outside the Imperium (to Darrian and the Sword Worlds ) was discontinued when the First Frontier War began in 589, and has never been resumed.

In 951, service was established to the Five Sisters subsector through Biter (1526), Caladbolg (1329), and Flammarion (0930). That service was suspended in 1107 when the Fifth Frontier War started, and resumed in 1111.

Scheduled Service
Al Moral's 53 ships should mean that with perfect traffic, each world would be visited by a new ship once every week. As a practical matter, the convolutions of the Al Morai route system make ship visits somewhat less frequent - one ship visits each world once per four weeks (with a 50% chance that it is going in a specific direction).

Starport Installations
Al Morai maintains starport facilities (under the control of its Markets Division) at worlds along its trade routes. With a few exceptions, Al Morai serves only class A and B starports , and facilities are maintained only at such starports .

In order to keep its routes open for their full length, Al Morai has found it necessary to establish facilities at the class C starports on Carey (2726) and Roup (2007). These installations supply refined fuel for At Morai ships and provide all of the facilities that are present at other Al Morai installations. The fuel and repair facilities are exclusively for the use of Al Morai, and effectively upgrade the class C starport to class B for Al Morai.

Overhaul Facilities
Al Morai maintains its own overhaul and maintenance facilities for its fleet of cargo carriers. One shipyard operates at Mora (3124), where Al Morai also has its head office. The other operates on Al Morai's wholly-owned planet, Shirene (2125). Both facilities operate at full capacity, overhauling one ship every two weeks.

Al Morai Starships
Al Morai maintains a homogeneous fleet of 53 Type MK Mora-class cargo carriers . Officially, these are classed as merchant couriers. The quantity 53 allows one ship to be present at each world along Al Morai's routes, as well as one ship in maintenance at each of the two overhaul facilities.

Al Morai also protects the ships on their routes with a squadron of four Route Protectors. Cruising the trade routes on a random basis, these ships maintain an armed presence for the line and act as a deterrent to piracy against Al Morai.

Merchant Ships
Al Moral's Mora-class ships are named for the worlds on the company routes, for example, Regina , Fornice , Bendor , and Jewell . Two additional ships are named Imperial Glory and Imperial Reign.

These 3,000-ton ships are capable of jump-4 and 1 G. Cargo capacity is 1,200 tons; there are staterooms for 30 passengers.

Each ship carries three 40-ton shuttles for ground contact; the ship itself is unstreamlined .

 
Route Protectors
Al Morai's route protectors are privately constructed Gazelle-class close escorts.

The 400-ton close escort was originally designed as an anti-piracy vessel and is better adapted to that role than to large scale naval combat. In Al Morai service, the close escort is used as a piracy deterrent and as a fast messenger.

These 400 ton ships are capable of jump-4 and 4G. With drop tanks installed and dropped, jump-5 and 5G. With drop tanks not installed, jump-2 and 5G. Cargo capacity is 6 tons. There are eight staterooms for the crew of 12.

Each close escort carries a 20-ton streamlined armed gig , which is required for surface contact because the close escort is unstreamlined.

Amber Zone

Traveller's Aid Society classification for a nation, world or system which presents a need for caution in dealings and activities. The amber zone may indicate chaos, upheaval, or xenophobia in local business, politics, society, or culture, or may be applied for other reasons. Travellers should exercise caution.

Anagathics

Drugs that counteract the aging process. A regimen of monthly doses enables an individual to ignore the debilitating effects of advancing years. Because of the rarity and demand for anagathics, they are quite expensive and are often unavailable at any price.

An important ingredient in anagathics treatment is kesternet, a plant which grows only on St George (hex 2616) in the Vland sector.

Ancients

The name given to a race of intelligent, alien beings who inhabited various locations in this portion of the galaxy approximately -300 000. Archeological evidence recovered from excavations of the few known Ancient cities indicates that the race destroyed itself during a 2000 year conflict known as the Final War, which left only ruined cities and shattered planets.

The Ancients were responsible for several major features within the region now occupied by the Imperium. Their warfare resulted in the large proportion of asteroid belts throughout this spiral arm. There is evidence that they created the multiworld rosette at Tireen (in the Vargr Extents). Scattered empty cities (most severely damaged by war) stand as evidence of their conflict; most, however, are under investigation by the Imperium and are not open to the public.

The Ancients are generally accepted as responsible for the dissemination of Humaniti within its current domain when they transplanted genetic stock from Terra to at least forty worlds across a span of some 360 parsecs. Similarly they were also responsible for the creation of the Vargr through the genetic manipulation of carnivore/chaser animals. Apparently they used Terran canine stock acquired at the same time as Humaniti.

Anglic

The official language of the Third Imperium. A distant descendant of Terran English, Anglic was the language of the Rule of Man (-2294 to -1776). Anglic remained a common interstellar language for trade and commerce during the Long Night. Its widespread use on the original worlds of the Third Imperium made it the natural language when the Imperium was established.

On many worlds, Anglic is only a second language used for system traffic control, commercial operations, and interstellar communications. Anglic is often called Galanglic (for Galactic Anglic). The Imperium has not been able to prevent the emergence of a wide variety of Anglic dialects. Interstellar communications, holocrystals, and recordings help to spread a uniform pronunciation of Anglic throughout the entire Imperium.

Within the Imperium, any Anglic speaker can understand almost any other, but isolated communities on worlds with little contact with interstellar trade lanes shift their speech patterns to form dialects. In addition, broad areas within the Imperium have established their own pronunciation patterns; accepted dialects include Rim (which includes Terra), Core (the central region of the Imperium), Riftian (the spinward frontiers), and Transform (the Antares region).

Antares

Trailing region of the Imperium. The name is applied to a variety of places at the trailing fringe of the Imperium. Antares is a domain of the Imperium, a sector within that domain, and capital of that sector.

^^^^

League of Antares

An automonous region within the Imperium. The worlds were originally pressed into the Imperium in 89 during the Antarean Pacification Campaign. The worlds were occupied by the Julian Protectorate during the Julian War. When regained for the Imperium at the end of the war, the peace terms included a mandate that the League of Antares be given limited automony for control of trade, commerce, and internal affairs.

The automony of the League served as a model for the later establishment of the Solomani Automonous Region.

Ansing Expedition

Famous exploration of the accessible reaches of the gas giant Annikkittar in the Pretoria system in 870 to 884. Extensive use of specially designed exploration vessels, protective suits, and high technology equipment allowed the Ansing Foundation of Vland to extensively map and explore the upper reaches of the gas giant's atmosphere.

^^^^

Antebellum

Literally, before the war. General historical term referring to the period within the Imperium before the Civil War, specifically 210 to 604.

The Antebellum period was characterised by expansion of the Imperium with large scale colonisation efforts, integration of numerous regions into Imperial society, and an overall mood of growth and exploration. With the end of the Antebellum period, the Imperium turned more attention inward and devoted resources to internal development and consolidation.

Aslan

A race of intelligent beings with an established interstellar dominion spinward and rimward of the Imperium; in addition large numbers have settled within the Imperium.

Aslan stand roughly human-sized, averaging 2.0 metres in height and weighing about lOOkg. They are descended from fourlimbed, upright, bipedal carnivore/pouncer stock originally adapted to a solitary arboreal existence.

The earliest Terran explorers saw in them a vague resemblance to the Terran lion, and they have been described (by Imperials) as lion- like ever since, although there is very little true similarity. The derivation of the word Aslan is unknown. There are two sexes, male and female. The most notable difference is the increased size and mane of the former. Females outnumber males by 3 to 1.

Aslan have a highly specialised dewclaw under each thumb which folds back jackknife fashion into a horny covering in the base of the thumb and palm.

A vast Aslan dominated region (the Aslan Hierate) lies far to rimward, but Aslan themselves have ranged well beyond its borders, with many settling within the Imperium and attaining full status as citizens. As such, they subordinate themselves to Imperial authority, although they have remained culturally separated from human society. Aslan serve in the Imperial armed forces; they achieve nobility; they pay taxes; they run businesses.

See also Aslan Border Wars, Aslan Hierate.

^^^^

Aslan Society

The Aslan are a warrior race, proud, noble, and devoted to those in authority above them. An individual Aslan is usually a member of a family of from 2 to 12 individuals under a patriarchal leader. Several families will combine into a pride with one dominant family. A number of prides form a clan, with a dominant pride. Aside from military organisations and the ruling council (within the Hierate), the clan is the highest socio-political unit among the Aslan.

A deep-seated territorial instinct causes the aslan to have an inordinate (from a human standpoint) concern with land. For male Aslan, owning land is a major goal in life. An Aslan's stature is determined by the amount of land he (or her husband) controls, or by the amount of land owned by any higher lord the Aslan may be vassal to. The lowest classes of Aslan are landless, and provide the farmers, labourers, craftsmen, and factory workers. A holder of a large territory will often grant authority over it to vassals (usually sons, brothers, or male relatives by marriage) who administer the land in his name.

The sexes have very different roles in Aslan society. Males (in all but the lower classes) are concerned mostly with military operations, acquisition of territory, and political affairs.

Females are concerned with trade, industry, and the accumulation of knowledge. Upper class males have little conception of money and are literally incapable of functioning in a technological society without aid, so they are thus seldom encountered without the supervision of a wife, mother, or other female relative or employer.

For instance, a typical Aslan mercenary unit will be organised by a wealthy married female, who will then assign its operation, for a share of the proceeds, to an unmarried female relative. The battle commander and most of the troops will be unmarried males (many of them also relatives) hired with the promise of land grants (and the opportunity to gain honour and reputation in combat); however, staff, operations, supply, and intelligence officers will generally be female.

The extremely deadly nature of any combat between Aslan has led to a rigid, ritualised pattern of behaviour designed to reduce conflict. Aslan are very polite, and while most have learnt to be patient with non-Aslan, accidental fights still occur. Disputes between individuals are handled by the patriarchs; disputes between families are handled by the pride leaders; disputes between prides are handled by clan leaders.

Aslan Calender

The Aslan calender is based on the period of Kuzu (the Aslan homeworld) around Tyeyo, its star. The Aslan ftahea (year) is 319.98 standard days in length.

Aslan Border Wars (-1118 to 380)

A series of conflicts between various Aslan clans and human systems as the Aslan expanded toward already settled human territory. The Aslan achieved jump drive late(-1999) and proceeded to expand into available territory in their region of space. Contacts along their trailing border necessarily resulted in friction with the human systems in that region.

Because the Long Night was already well under way by the time the Aslan encountered humans, there was no central human government to resist Aslan attacks. Since there was no united Aslan authority either, the sides were fairly matched, and numerous small wars erupted between Aslan clans and human splinter states, with alliances between the various powers constantly forming and dissolving.

The border between human and Aslan space remained relatively constant, with a few systems changing hands after each war. At this time some clans also launched raids into the interior of the former Imperial domains, where they conquered and settled worlds as much as 40 parsecs beyond the border.

Once the Third Imperium expanded into the region(circa 200), its superior organisation and technology gradually put an end to the Aslan threat. The final treaties, known as the Peace of Ftahalr, were negotiated with all the major clans. They established a buffer zone about 30 parsecs wide between the Imperial border and the region of Aslan control. There has been no war since then(380), although the Solomani have violated portions of the zone and incorporated it into their boundaries.

See also Aslan, Aslan Hierate.

^^^^

Aslan Hierate

Interstellar, multisector government of the many Aslan clans. Aslan society centres on the clan. Within the Hierate, the family structure of the Aslan and the governmental structure are the same. The highest governmental functions are performed by a council of twenty-nine clan leaders chosen from amongst the most powerful clans.

"the 29"(as they are known) have a quasireligious status and represent the essential unity of the Aslan race. To be chosen one of the "the 29" is the highest honour to which an Aslan can aspire. The 29 meet continuously on Kuzu to adjudicate interclan disputes and decide matters of group policy. No member of the 29 speaks for the Hierate as a whole, nor does the whole 29.

There are no Hierate armed forces; each clan has its own, and rarely act in concert with those of other clans. The Hierate itself can call upon military forces only in so far as the clans themselves agree to provide such forces. Even the minor forces conveying the 29's decisions are actually under the control of individual clan leaders.

Right of Assassination

A method of ascension to the Imperial throne which involves the assassination of the present Emperor, along with all heirs, by the pretender to the throne. The assassin can then claim the throne, subject to the approval of the Moot. Originally established in order to remove the Emperor Cleon III (also known as Cleon the Mad) when he demonstrated homicidal tendancies.

However, the murder of Empress Nicholle by Cleon IV in 475 led to a revival of the method, and ultimately to the Civil War in 606.

^^^^

Astrography

The science of mapping interstellar space. Basic to any science of mapping is a coordinate system. The system used by the Imperium is based on rings of longitude, rays of latitude, and parsecs. By convention, rays of latitude are measured from a starting point at Reference/Core, this world being at ray 0000 and on the ring 10 000 parsecs from the centre of the galaxy.

The system is highly Imperio-centric, and liable to break down beyond certain limits. However it admirably serves within the area surrounding the Imperium. Other states use different conventions, but the Imperial system is widely accepted by many client states. In ordinary discourse, a world is refered to by its name, sector and/or subsector. For example the home of the first Barracks Emperor, Olav, is Rhylanor/Rhylanor/Spinward Marches.

Battle Rider

Non-jump capable ship intended to stand in the line of battle in space combat and carried interstellar by a battle tender. Two opposite views in naval architecture have dominated the design of the major battleships of space navies. The battle rider concept involves a large jump-capable tender carrying many (two to ten) heavily armed and armoured battle riders. The opposite concept is the battleship, a large jump-capable ship which carries the jump drives and fuel tanks internally.

The battle tender, so integral to the concept of the battle rider, is little more than a large dispersed structure with jump drives, fuel tanks, and basic controls. By dispensimg with the need for jump drives and associated fuel tanks on each of the riders, each becomes ton for ton more heavily armed and armoured.

It is generally held that, in any meeting between a battleship and a battle rider of equal displacement, the battle rider will triumph.

See also Battleship, Battle Tender.

^^^^

Battleship

Jump capable starship intended to stand in the line of battle in space combat.

The battleship concept involves well armed and armoured starships of massive displacement and capable of meeting almost any adversary. In battle against superior forces, however, the battleship can flee using its own jump drives. The opposite concept (of battle riders carried into combat by a battle tender) does not allow for the possibility of superior force; no matter how good a rider is, if it meets a superior adversary, it is placed in a posistion of winning or dying. Retreat is nearly impossible without losses.

Battle Tender

Interstellar ship transport intended to carry battle riders into combat. Generally a dispersed structure, it transports a squadron of battle riders ready for immediate launch upon entry into a system. While riders press the attack, the tender stays in the reserve for protection. See also Battle Rider.

"Behind the Claw"

A slang term used by inhabitants of the Spinward Marches, Deneb and Trojan Reaches sectors to refer to these areas. The term derives from a supposed resemblance between a claw and the Great Rift, as seen on maps of the Imperium.

Inhabitants of this region feel a certain pride in the designation, and it is used to imply that they share a camaraderie and common interest. The name was once used as the title of a popular news magazine with a
circulation area encompassing the three sectors named above. The term is rarely used by inhabitants of other areas of the Imperium.

Belt Mining

The process of extracting useful minerals and other substances from asteroids. Asteroids fall into three basic categories for mining purposes.

Nickel Iron
Nickel-iron asteroids are reasonably dense, high-grade sources of metals, and are also useful to the shipbuilding industry as hull material.

Carbonaceous
The most common asteroid type, and also that with the lowest value. The best markets for such rocks are space colonies and largeistations which make use of the various useful elements which can extracted from them.

Ice chunks
Made up of frozen volatiles, including methane, water, etc. Hence, these "dirty snowballs" are a source of hydrogen fuel, and so support "ice miners". The main markets are starports and space stations which cannot, for one reason or another, use more convenient sources, such as oceans or gas giants.

None of these types are particularly valuable, and will never make a miner rich. However many asteroids, especially nickeliron types, contain rare minerals, platinum, lanthanum, etc.

Occasionally, an asteroid may be valuable for scientific, or even aesthetic, purposes. Finally there are the products of civilisations, from the week old wreck to the treasure trove of the Ancients.

^^^^

Belter

Strictly speaking, one who practises the profession of asteroid prospector and miner, usually working alone or with a small number of partners. Loosely, any resident of an asteroid belt (including citizens of civilised belts such as Glisten, some of whom have never been in a spaceship).

^^^^

Blistein Yards

The Blistein company of Glisten (Spinward Marches/Glisten) has achieved a high reputation for specialist starships of nonstreamlined types. Although constructing on a small scale compared to builders like Ling Standard, Blistein vessels are sought after due to their attention to customers' special requirements.

Blistein is the main supplier of private yachts to the Marcher Nobility, and this provides the bulk of their output.

Occasionally, however, a class of vessels such as the Leviathan merchant cruisers are turned out, and several powered planetoid types have also been constructed.

^^^^

Boat

Any defensive non-starship. In general, the term boat is reserved for craft produced for local defensive operations. While non-interstellar in nature, they are heavily armed and armoured.

Also, any small craft used interplanetary. See also Gunboat, System Defence Boat.

Children of the March

A fleet intruder (later frontier cruiser) of the Azhanti High Lightening class. Tail number 6355. Laid down 095- 994. First flight 117-997. Displacement 60000 and heavily armed.

The Children of the March was unusual in this class of ships primarily for its method of finance. The boost to subsector ecomony created by the award of starship construction contracts is always important enough to make all areas of the Imperium vie for the privilege. At the time of the bidding invitations, the Solomani Rim War (990 to 1002) was burning on the other side of the Imperium; there was little chance that the Spinward Marches would receive a contract.

The Duke of Regina, speaking for the Marches, proposed that the marches fund one additional ship from its own resources, on condition that the Marches would receive a portion of the total run. The school children of the worlds within the Marches contributed their lunch money, at a quarter credit each, for the ultimate funding of one ship, and it was named Children of the March in their honour. Reportedly, some backwater schools districts still collect for the "Starship Fund".

Church of the Chosen Ones

A fanatical Vargr sect which believes that the Ancients not only "invented" the Vargr race by genetic manipulation of Terran carnivores, but that the Ancients also returned to the Vargr several times and improved the race to the point that it could take its rightful place as the leader of this part of the galaxy. Some Church members even believe that the Ancients will return to bring this about. The Church has waned in influence since its founding 200 years ago, but it still has followers on many worlds.

Civil War
(606 to 622)

Fought between various factions within the Imperium for control of the bureacracy. It had its origin in the strain on communications within the Imperium caused by the long time lags dictated by the very size of the Imperium. To cite one cause, however, would be simplistic. The diverse backgrounds of the many constituents of the Imperium had its effects, as did rivalry for power by major naval and military commanders and a lessening in the Imperium's expansionist tendancies.

The spark which started the Civil War came from the First Frontier War (589 to 604) in the Spinward Marches. Communication lags and a lack of preparedness forced the Marches to conduct most of the war on its own with| little additional help or support from the Imperium. Grand Admiral of the Marches Olav hault-Plankwell forced the war to an end and found solid support for a new government. Marching on Capital with his war fleet, he forced an audience with Empress Jacqueline I, supposedly for recognition of his war effort. In the course of the meeting he personally murdered the Empress, and then proclaimed himself Emperor by right of fleet control. The ensuing power struggle lasted through 18 years and 17 emperors.

The fighting in the Civil War was of two varieties: fringe battles for power bases, and central battles for power in the Core. The fringe battles were fought throughout the Imperium as rival factions recruited forces. Once any power block built up enough strength to make victory seem possible, the forces were moved to the Core and used to either seize power or to wrest it away from someone else.

But there was also a cheaper, easier route open to many. The dynastic crisis of 244 had produced a precedent for assassination of the emperor if he or she overstepped the bounds of legitimate activity. The concept was introduced to legitimise the elimination of Cleon the Mad and was never intended for any other purpose. Nevertheless, in the turmoil of the Civil War, assassination was introduced and accepted, at least by those utilising the technique, as a way of promoting a succession in government.

The line of Emperors during the Civil War came mostly from naval officers, and they are collectively called the Emperors of the Flag. Of these seventeen seven were assassinated and ten were killed in battle; the line was ended by the person sometimes considered the eighteenth Emperor of the Flag - Arbellatra.

During the course of the Civil War, the Outworld Coalition (of Zhodani and Vargr) saw that their defeat in the First Frontier War at the hands of Olav need not be permenant. They attacked again in the Second Frontier War (615 to 620). Their defeat in that war had greater effects than they would know. Grand Admiral Arbellatra Alkhalikoi managed the meager forces of the Spinward Marches against the Coalition and forced a second defeat.

Arbellatra's strategy after the war was (like Olav) to march on Capital and seize power. She, however, did not make the mistake of seizing the throne. Instead, she defeated the putative emperor and then took possession of power, holding it in trust for a rightful successor. She held the post of regent for seven years while a search for a member of Jacqueline's family could be found to take the throne. In the stability that followed with her as regent, she made an impression on the Moot and succeeded in establishing a broad power base. Ultimately, the Moot approached her to take the throne herself, an end which was probably in her mind all along.

With the end of the Civil War, the Imperium entered a period of renewed expansion and consolidation. The express boat system was established to enhance government, commercial, and private communications; the Solomani influence in the Imperium was lessened and replaced with a more cosmopolitan policy; renewed efforts at interior development of existing Imperial territories provided a new focus for the nobles of the Moot.

Clan Severn

A Rhylanor based shipbuilder, with associated facilities on Jae Tellona and Margesi. The Rhylanor yard concentrates on filling Naval contracts, while civil and merchant operations are dealt with on Margesi. The Jae Tellona facilities engages primarily in maintenance and overhauls, but is also capable of constructing some of the simpler components for the other yards.

Client State

An independent political unit which has elected (or had forced upon it) the patronage of a larger political unit.

This relationship is generally mutually beneficial and is essentially commercial in nature. That is, the political or defensive ties which may be part of any patron-client relationship are ultimately intended to promote trade between the two.

Confederation

Group of independent states, worlds, or systems united for specified purposes while generally retaining more freedom of action than the members of a federation. Also known as a league or alliance (especially of princes, nations, states, worlds, or systems).

^^^^

Corridor

Imperial sector containing 267 systems dramatically split by the Great Rift; 69 systems lie rimward of the Rift and 149 systems form the coreward third of the sector. Corridor is named for its role connecting old, well-established Vland sector with the frontier sectors Deneb and the Spinward Marches. The name Corridor dates from about 140 and has displaced the old Vilani name (Eneri, rough translation: "star salad") for the sector.

Coyns

Of the rare artifacts recovered from Ancient sites, the most common are coyns, small disks of metal engraved with various symbols. Their specific use is unknown. It may be that the objects served as money, jewelry, mystic focii, or some other unknown purpose.

Coyns have been found in various precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, iridium, and even monadium. Sets range in size from six to thirty-eight pieces and are considered desirable to museums throughout the Imperium. Each coyn has a scrap value of Cr400 (if gold); to a museum, the value is closer to Cr4000.

Crisis of '99

Albert Croale, in his book Almost Disaster presents a hypothesis that the Third Frontier War (979 to 986) occurred two centuries too late. After reviewing the progress of events in the spinward reaches of the Imperium from the antebellum period to the late seventh century, Croale then analyses the rise of the Psionics Institutes, their growing public acceptance, and their spreading power. Finally, he presents that a straight projection of events would predict a resurgence of the Outworld Coalition, increased hostilities, and a Third Frontier War.

Instead, his hypothesis as stated in his book indicates that the Psionic Suppressions (800 to 826 and beyond) were a massive manipulation of the population of the Imperium, a form of psychohistory, intended to eliminate the power of the institutes.

Preparations were ongoing for war, and the Imperium made representations of strength (in 799) to the Coalition. It backed down.

But the pyschohistory project went wrong and resulted in widespread rejection of psionics as a whole within the Imperium to the point that even the government had difficulty in using the science of psionics for its official purposes.

Cruiser

A ship capable of independant operations and of support of the main line of battle. Cruisers are intended to fulfil two diverse missions- in battle, they support and reinforce capital ships which are present and which form the main line of battle, generally from the flanks, and they perform seperate operations, often acting as the centre of task forces which have no capital ships. Cruisers are also put to use as independant ships.

Currency
Imperial

The basic unit of legal tender in the Imperium is the Imperial credit. Individual worlds may issue their own currencies, and those currencies may or may not be acceptable on other worlds. Similarly, corporations and megacorporations may issue scrip, and its acceptance outside of the corporate environment is a matter of conjecture. But Imperial credits are accepted everywhere in the Imperium and many locations outside of it.

Imperial credits are almost impossible to counterfeit because of their unique method of manufacture. Plastic fibres are combined under high temperature and pressure and extruded as a rectangular bundle of great length. The different coloured fibres form the pattern of the bill. It is not printed but actually made a part of the structure of the note. The bundle is sliced into paper thinness, and a 14-digit alphanumeric is added for uniqueness.

Credit bills are issued in 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 10000 credit denominations. Plastic coins, manufactured in a similar manner in various shapes, are issued in quarter (a quart), half (a demi), one, and five (a bec) credit denominations.

Imperial credits can be bulky in large enough quantities. Bills measure 75 x 125 millimetres; 1000 bills stand 50 millimetres high and weigh 500 grammes.

Darmine

Cultural region in Zarushagar sector. Darmine had a separate but submerged cultural identity within the First Imperium and happily threw off that domination when the it fell. Allowed to flourish by the Rule of Man, the community of worlds survived the Long Night with little harm.

The first Darmine Corporate, an economic consortium, existed from -1643 to 100 and covered about five subsectors. This interstellar common market came to an end during the Ilelish Pacification Campaign (76 to 120); indeed, the Darmine Corporate was the major focus of that campaign.

The main world of the Darmine region is Ishag ( Lias / Zarushagar 1323). A peculiarity of that world is that the natives do not use an "ian" or "er" suffix.

Darrian Confederation

Group of worlds in the Darrian subsector (Spinward Marches) settled by humans from Darrian (Spinward Marches/Darrian 0627 A463955-G) during the period 1137 to -927.

The current capital is Mire (Spinward Marches/ Darrian 0527 A665A95).

The Darrian Confederation contains 18 worlds within the same subsector and has a population of 17.19 billion. Darrians are humans who developed independently on Darrian. Some Solomani blood is evident from Solomani traders who encountered Darrian in -1511 and provided them with sufficient technology to explore their subsector.

The Darrian Confederation is a Client State of the Imperium. It has had long standing conflicts with the Sword Worlds.

Deneb

Imperial sector containing 385 systems lying beyond the Great Rift; named for the sector's brightest star, Deneb.

Deneb sector was fragmentarily settled by both Vilani and Vargr during the latter years of the First Imperium, but major developments of the sector only took place after Third Imperium Scout Service explorations located major resource worlds in quantity.

Industrial worlds that exploited those resources soon created trade routes and commercial ties that linked the Imperial core with the Spinward Marches.

Deneb sector is primarily Imperial. The Imperial border runs just within the coreward edge of the sector, and scattered Vargr systems (as well as non-aligned systems and client states) lie beyond the border.

Digest Touring Award

Outstanding journalism award offered every seven years by the Travellers Digest magazine (a popular magazine with a wide circulation in the spinward sectors of the Imperium, available on either plastic vellum or electronic media).

The recipient, who must be a professional journalist living and working "behind the claw", is given honorary membership in the Travellers' Aid Society. (worth one million credits); he or she is then expected to travel through the region during the tenure of the award and to submit a feature article once every thirteen weeks. The intent of the Digest is to "promote understanding of cultural diversity within the Imperium". The most recent winner of the award, in 1100 is Akidda Laagiir an editor of the Mora World Review on Mora (Spinward Marches/Mora 0704 AA99AC7-F).

Galactic Directions

North, south, east, west are insufficient terms for referring to directions within the galaxy. Instead, the following conventions have achieved widespread acceptance when referring to direction:

Toward the galactic core (toward Capital from Terra) is coreward; away from it, in the direction of the rim, is rimward. In the direction in which the galaxy is rotating (toward Regina from Vland) is spinward, and the opposite direction is trailing.

These directions are widely used in describing Imperial features and businesses. For example, the Spinward Marches is a Sector at the extreme spinward fringe of the Imperium.

Finally, within the Imperium, the term coreward is also used to indicate the direction of Capital, the Imperial core. There is some potential for confusion if the term is accepted out of context.

Droyne

Intelligent major race inhabiting scattered worlds within an area larger than the region of the current Third Imperium. The Droyne are a small race derived from winged omnivore gatherers.

They vary in size depending on caste but generally stand one metre tall (large workers and warriors can be larger than humans). The history of their evolution remains a puzzle because their homeworld is not known with any certainty.

Droyne society is divided into rigid castes determined when an individual reaches adolescence. The six castes of the Droyne each serve different functions within Droyne society. Although identical at the time of caste selection, caste members develop pronounced physical and mental differences by maturity. Different genetic programs are awakened by differences in diet and environment among the various castes. Young leaders, for instance, experience a nearly 30 percent increase in brain size in the first year after casting. The following are descriptions and definitions of castes:

Workers
Manual labour and mundane ordinary activity are not too smart and are temperamentally suited to contentment with ordinary labour and subservient tasks.

Warrior
Trained for combat and possessing comparatively well developed muscles and reflexes, the warrior is the security troop, the marine, and the policeman of the Droyne culture. They are common in frontier bases, and less numerous in civilised areas.

Drone
Drones have a variety of purposes in Droyne society. They perform a reproductive role which makes them parents to Droyne young, and they have a role in the ceremonies which determine caste for maturing young. In addition, drones comprise a sort of middle management caste, which is responsible for many of the routine functions in business, trade, and administration.

Technician
This caste is the science-orientated portion of Droyne society and is concerned with both research and practical implementation of technology.

Sport
Although the caste system of the Droyne is rather rigid, the sport is the deliberately accepted exception to caste structure. Sports are special individuals who cross caste lines to become scouts, messengers, representatives, hunters, prospectors, and to take other occupations that require individual initiative or separation from Droyne society for long periods of time. A sport is the most commonly encountered Droyne outside their own worlds.

Leader
Leaders are required to manage and direct society. They are ultimately responsible for everything that the Droyne as a whole do.

Society
There is little individual freedom in Droyne society, and as a result, society and government join into one concept.

Workers work. Leaders lead. All of society is dedicated to continuing the existence that provides all members with food, shelter and the other amenities that make life enjoyable. In addition, there is little discord in Droyne society when things are running smoothly, as each member of society has its own function to perform. Only when disaster occurs is the group forced to strain.

A typical Droyne group consists of a variety of Droyne from the different castes. There will be many workers, few drones and leaders, and technicians and warriors based on current needs.

Each group will also have several sports, although they may not be present; instead they may be occupied with their own solitary tasks.

This is not to say Droyne are mindless. Leaders are-quite capable and responsible; warriors haveistrategic and tactical senses; technicians are inventive and clever. But all accept the central group as a part of their lives and work for its benefit above their own.

Ebokin

Sophont race native to Yebab. Ebokin (singular: Eibokin) are bilaterally symmetrical and are built low to the ground, with eight legs and four small manipulative arms set close to the head. Adult female Ebokin average 0.8 metres tall, 1.5 metres long, and 130 kg in weight; males are somewhat smaller. Ebokin society is a very conservative matriarchy, bound by strict, unchanging laws. Ebokin seldom leave their homeworld.

Emissary

Ex-imperial Navy fleet intruder (formally the Sparkling Distress) of the Azhanti High Lightening class. Tail number 6379.

Laid down 138-997. First flight 121-1000.

Currently in Oberlindes Lines service in the Vargr Extents.

Somehow, Oberlindes managed to purchase the ship with its weaponry intact, which violates Imperial regulations. Thus, the ship is unable to return to the Imperium. However, the Emissary has operated successfully as an Oberlindes flagship in the Extents and has proven effective, by the implied threat of its presence, in protecting Oberlindes shipping from piracy. The Emissary is armed with a large spinal mount particle accelerator and considerable secondary weaponry.

Emperors of the Flag

During the Civil War period (604 to 622), the Imperium was in the hands of a series of naval officers of flag (admiral) rank. These eighteen emperors achieved the throne through assassination, fleet action, political manoeuvres, and general mayhem. The year 619 particularly saw six emperors hold the throne, none of them for more than three months.

The succession of Emperors of the Flag began with the seizure of the throne by Olav hault-Plankwell in 604, which precipitated the Civil War. It ended with the naming of Arbellatra as regent of the Imperium by the Moot in 622.

Express Boat

Rapid communication ships which are designed to make optimum use of jump technology in communicating information within the Imperium. Because the Imperium is so large, ordinary communication must depend on ships travelling along established trade routes, making Regina nearly 4 years out from the Imperial Core.

The express boat (abbreviated Xboat) system, established originally in 624 and expanded to cover the entire Imperium by 718, cuts this communication time by nearly 75 percent. Selected locations along major trade routes are established as sites for express stations, which are orbital facilities which service and refuel the Xboats on their communication runs.

As an Xboat arrives in a system, it beams its recorded data to the express boat station, which then retransmits it to an Xboat standing by for a jump outsystem. Time between jumps is almost always under four hours and has been recorded at under seven minutes, making the speed of communication nearly the speed of jump (since Xboats carry jump-4 drives, speeds near four parsecs a week). In practise, this speed is somewhat reduced by the fact that trade routes do not follow straight lines and that not all jumps are made at jump-4. Nonetheless, the system achieves approximately jump-2.6 per week.

First Frontier War
(589 to 604)

The first of the border clashes between the Imperium and the Zhodani, which sparked the beginning of a continuing antipathy between the two major lines of humaniti.

With the conclusion of the war, Olav hault-Plankwell returned to the Imperial core with his war fleet and took the reins of government, dispatching Empress Jacqueline and thus starting the Civil War and the reign of the Barracks Emperors.

First Imperium
(-4045 to -2204)

The first modern interstellar civilisation, politically and culturally dominated by humans originating on Vland. The jump drive was discovered on Vland in -9235. Immediately the Vilani discovered a number of interfertile and technologically primitive human races on worlds within 60 parsecs. These were gradually brought to a high technology state with Vilani help and assimilated into a loose interstellar community bound by trade and common culture.

Eventually, the client races themselves explored beyond the local sphere, contacting and trading with still more races. These new races gained their technology without being assimilated into the Vilani culture; the resulting increased friction caused a series of wars beginning in about -5400.

In response to the threat, Vland began tightening its control of its trade sphere, and finally organising it into a centralised state in -5273. This marked the beginnings of the First Imperium, although there was as yet no emperor. During the thousand year period of the Consolidation Wars, Vland conquered and absorbed its enemies until there were no longer any civilised states on its borders (except for a portion of the Vargr Extents, isolated from the Imperium by the Windhorn).

The last war ended in -4045, and the Vilani declared the establishment of an interstellar empire to govern all Vilani territory. Known as the Grand Empire of the Stars or Ziru Sirka, the Vilani dating begins at this point. With no exterior threats, the Ziru Sirka lasted for nearly 1200 years; at its height, which was attained soon after the end of the wars, the First Imperium contained 27 sectors and over 15 000 worlds.

However, the cost of maintaining centralised control over this vast expanse was cultural rigidity; exploration had ceased with the beginning of the wars; now scientific research slowed to a halt, and the beginnings of a hereditary caste system began to emerge. Civilisation was in decline.

As long as there was no exterior threat, the Grand Empire was safe; but gradually, despite all efforts, technology leaked across the borders. New interstellar states arose, and the Imperium could no longer afford to absorb them. Slowly, the Imperium lost territory along its coreward and trailing marches.

Then, in -2422, the Imperium was contacted along its rimward border by the Terrans, who had recently emerged into space.

Terran expansionism led to a series of interstellar wars which ultimately resulted in Terran conquest of the Imperium in -2204 and the founding of the Rule of Man.

First Interstellar War
(-2408 to - 2400)

The first military engagement between the Vilani of the First Imperium, and the Solomani of the Terran Confederation. This began an on-again, off- again series of wars between these two major human races, which ended in the defeat of the First Imperium and the beginning of the ascendance of the Solomani.

Flame Sculpture

A Darrian art form. Developed before the super- nova which destroyed interstellar interaction in that region for 700 years. Initially, techniques were invented to shape flame using gravitic technology, application being in such things as cutting torches. However, it was discovered that the flames could be molded, and artisans began practising this new art. Busts, landscapes, and other 3-D subjects were sculpted in flame, along with letters, company names and logos.

As with many Darrian artifacts, those created before the disaster (known as Early sculpture) are considered the best, and are all simple in form, with the rarest being sculpted while the Darrian worlds struggled to survive (known as Maghiz) Modern sculpture is far more complex than the older forms, and is less prized by art lovers.

Short inconclusive war fought primarily in the Jewell subsector (Spinward Marches sector) between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate. The war began with initial assaults by the Zhodani against Jewell and Regina subsectors stalled at the borders. Its final battle the Battle of Two Suns, 1084, was waged in the vicinity of Yres and Menorb and resulted in Imperial victory. The armistice was signed before instructions for the conduct of the war were received from Capital.

General Products
LIC

Largely concerned with heavy industry, General is a manufacturer of starships, non-starships and heavy machinery of all sorts. General is known for inexpensive products of adequate quality, but of late its starship division (particulary its military products) has been plagued with disaster.

The largest starship manufacturer in the Regina subsector, General has yards at Regina ( Regina / Spinward Marches 1910), Efate ( Regina / Spinward Marches 1705) and Pixie ( Regina / Spinward Marches 1903). General no longer produces ships for military use, instead concentrating on the more lucrative commercial market. The yard at Regina is capable of producing ships up to 5000 tons, while the subsidiary yards at Pixie and Efate are limited to 600 tons per ship, and devote most of their attention to annual maintenances.

The corporation was formed by the merger of a number of smaller manufacturing concerns shortly after the end of the Civil War, in the period 620 to 622.

In the Spinward Marches, General owns the shipyards on Regina and Efate, and holds the maintenance conccesion at Pixie naval base in addition to other insatallations. The last military contract held by these yards was for four Kinunir class vanguard escorts, all ill fated, and none presently in service.

Good War/Bad War

The terms "good war" and "bad war" are expressions used by mercenary soldiers to differentiate between small-scale actions, not involving Imperial forces, and large scale conflicts involving Imperial forces, including wars between the Imperium and other states.

Small scale actions are viewed as good because generally the Imperial rules of war are observed, preventing, among other things, the use of nuclear weapons. Good wars are usually short and not particulary bloody. A unit in a tight spot need merely surrender and activate its repatriation bonds to be removed from combatant status. Even antiguerilla actions are good, under this classification, because of the fact that although most guerillas usually observe no restraint with captured government forces, captured mercenaries can usually be ransomed to serve as a source of income.

A war is bad when no such controls are in effect, and a mercenary unit will be subject to the full horrors of war. Mercenary units are understandably reluctant to accept bad war contracts, but they may be forced into them, especially when near the border areas.

Grand Prince

Imperial titular designation of the heir to the Iridium Throne. Under Imperial custom, the eldest daughter or son of the Emperor becomes heir to the throne at the age of 12.

Elaborate ceremonies confer the title Grand Prince (or Grand Princess) on the heir and proclaim the information to the Imperium.

Great Rift

Broad expanse of space with a very low density of stars lying on the spinward borders of the main region of the Third Imperium. The Great Rift is a pronounced impediment to to interstellar travel, and it constrains jumps to the Spinward Marches through the Corridor sector.

The Great Rifts is one of the many astrographic features which have provided long-term security for the Third Imperium. By its very nature, the Great Rift has made outside incursions difficult, which has made the interior of the Imperium a secure population centre.

Groat

Herbivore native to Fulacin in the Rhylanor subsector.

Individual groats are harmless, but the outer members of a herd will attack any perceived danger in groups.

Groats have been transplanted to several worlds in the Aramis subsector, most notably Focaline.

The groat's shaggy hair (known as groatle) is the most obvious resources it provides. Once sheared, cleaned, and groomed, it has a softness and silkiness rivalling the finest synthetic. In addition, groatle contains metal salts, which has two beneficial effects. First, groatle cloth is proof against most small lifeforms (such as Terran moths) which eat other animal fibres.

Second, a simple chemical treatment brings out an iridescent, shimmering quality which is very attractive. Groats are also raised for their meat, which is highly prized by Vargr.

Gunboat

Ultimately, the distinction between ground, air sea and space craft disappears for military vehicles, and a single type of vehicle assumes all of the roles for system defence. Called gunboats, they are capable of extended operations in vacuum, atmosphere and water, ready to continue resistance to enemy action. Individually, the vessels are strongly armed, and can fight enemy ships while later supporting ground troops or bombing enemy installations. Further, they can continue resistance for long periods, hiding in oceans or local gas giants, and coming out only when there is promise of enemy losses.

Typically, a gunboat is fast, well-armed and well-armoured. It is capable of a wide variety of military responses, and has a high survival potential. Displacement is 200 to 600 tons. See also System Defense Boat.

Gvegh

A language group (including Gvegh, Gvegh-Aek, Knithnour, Uedhu, and Taeksu), spoken by 60% of all Vargr in the Spinward Marches, Deneb, and the sectors immediately coreward. Thus, it is the most commonly encountered Vargr language.

Hiver

Intelligent major race with a large federation trailing the Imperium. Hivers average 1.5 meters from ground to top of upraised head and weigh about 150 kg. Descended from omnivore gatherer/scavenger stock, they are the most alien of the major races. Hivers exhibit a modified six-fold radial symmetry; the body has a calcareous internal skeleton consisting of a series of rings supporting the limbs and a fused carapace protecting the brain and internal organs.

The head is a modification of one of the limbs and contains six eyestalks and six manipulative tentacles, plus paired infrared sensor organs. The other five limbs are identical (except for slight modifications of the hand opposite the head) and are used as arms and legs indiscriminately. Each limb ends in a six-fingered radial hand. Fingers are very flexible and have muscular suction cups on the lower surface about halfway to the tips. Hiver arms and hands are generally weaker than a human's but are very tough and difficult to injure.

The mouth (digestive opening) is on the lower surface of the body. There is no sound-producing organ, but Hivers do have three ears placed around the neck near the head. Hivers have only one sex. Reproductive cells are exchanged each time that Hivers meet, using the modified rear hand (the process has been termed by humans as "shaking hands"). The cells are kept in a reproductive pouch on the lower body surface where they conjugate and exchange genetic material. Once every forty days or so, a cell develops into a larva, which then drops from the parent's body.

Hive planets are mostly wilderness, and the larva enter the wilds, where most are killed. After about a year, survivors return to civilization, where they are welcomed into any nest and begin their education as citizens. Parental instinct in Hivers is very strong, and the young are adopted by the entire nest. (Note that this instinct applies only to the year old returnees; Hivers have no concern for younger larvae, and in fact they consider them minor pests).

Hiver language is a combination of arm/tentacle waving and physical contact. The written language is ideographic and is used as a standard language among the races of the Hive Federation. Hivers talking among themselves use all three aspects of language (gesture, touch and writing) at once, a process capable of great subtlety and sophistication, but unintelligible to the outsider.

Hivers are unique among the major races in that they had a complex culture before becoming sentient. Originally, they lived in the tunnels andbuilt-up mounds of a large (1000 kilogram) burrowing animal. In exchange for shelter, they gave food. They farmed fungus and foraged outside for decaying vegetation and dead animals as a source of food for the fungus.

Burrowers were allowed to graze the in the farm tunnels. Hivers ate the fungus and whatever fresh food they could find outside. Intelligence arose as the outside environment changed, forcing the foraging parties to travel farther to discover new sources of food and fertilizer; foragers advanced from simple scavenging and gathering efforts to complex cooperative efforts of hunting and trapping live game.

Today, fungus remains the staple of the Hiver diet; fungus growing is a highly developed art. Most buildings retain the beehive shape and large underground tunnel complexes of the original burrowers, but they are constructed by machines; the burrowers (known as snohl) are now reduced to the secondary function of keeping the tunnels clean. Hiver attachment to them is essentially irrational; they just feel more comfortable with snohl around.

Society
Hive society is highly individualistic. The term "Hive" results from an early Human misconception which stems from the appearance of the Hivers' building and tunnel complexes. Nests contain from five to five hundred individuals, who are usually centered around some common endeavor.

While one hundred is an average size for nests (and was the size in precivilized times), larger groups may come together for some civilized purpose such as large manufacturing companies or universities. Small nests are usually spaceship crews or isolated research parties. A young Hiver will spend its first fifteen years in its home nest; thereafter, nest changes may take place as often as a modern human might change jobs.

Because of the nature of their reproduction, Hivers never experienced the population pressures so important to human history. The population of the homeworld is now only a few hundred million, only ten times greater than it was in prehistoric times. Predators control the young; when the adult survival rate rises, thus increasing the number of young produced, the predator population increases proportionately and the balance is maintained. Space colonization arose not from pressures but from curiosity, with which Hivers are amply endowed.

The Hivers have colonized only those planets with climates most pleasant to themselves; if the planet has no predators that like to eat Hiver larvae, they are imported. Because of the high birth rate, a colony will rapidly fill up to its maximum population level of a few hundred million and will then stabilize. Hivers like planets of size 6 or less, with thin or standard atmospheres and unvarying climates. Hiver enclaves, for commercial or scientific purposes, are found on worlds of more extreme characteristics.

Hive industry and business excels at communications technology and robot construction. Major exports include artificial and computer languages, translators, and sophisticated electronic hardware of all types. Hiver mathematical systems are in much demand for their power and elegance.

Hive Federation

Human term for a loose interstellar community dominated by the Hivers; Hive Confederation is also sometimes used. The Hivers have only one culture and one language; the Hiver genotype (with individual variations similar in degree to differences between individual humans of the same race) is also constant.

The Federation government (if such a term is at all applicable) is mostly concerned with maintaining the uniformity of the Hiver culture and species. This is accomplished by frequent reproductive embassies from one planet to another. Members of many different nests will shake hands with everyone nearby in a sort of farewell party and will then board a large embassy ship bound for a far-off world. Once there, they will meet with as many people as possible, shaking hands and exchanging news, art, gossip, scientific information, political views, and so on for about a year. They will then return home for another year-long round of parties, discussions, and handshaking.

Most disputes among communities are handled in these embassies; others, considered too urgent or transient to wait for an embassy, are settled by judges. There is a considerable body of Hiver common law and custom, and a judge is a person who has spent years in study of the law; judges' decisions are not necessarily binding and are open to compromise, but they carry a great weight of custom.

The discovery of alien races and their integration into society required a slightly more formal organization, which grew out of the coordinating body which schedules embassies. Two additional bodies were established: the Federation Navy and a development agency.

The Hiver parental instinct was aroused by the discovery of numerous intelligent species less fortunate then themselves, and work began immediately to lift the "children" to civilization. An early experience with an aggressive race led to the establishment of a system of quarantined worlds, denied entry to (or knowledge of) interstellar society.

Covert operations are in progress on quarantine worlds to modify overly aggressive cultures into acceptable members of the Federation, and several quarantined worlds have so far been opened since the beginning of the program. So far, no quarantined race is close to achieving interstellar travel on its own; public debate continues on what to do in such a case.

The navy is the main instrument of military force. Hivers came late to the concept of war and are more comfortable with hightech, long-range oriented violence; they dislike the personal approach of ground combat.

When ground forces are absolutely needed, other races of the Federation generally provide troops. Federation armed forces are essentially a deterrent force and are seldom used as an instrument of policy.

Other races of the Federation are equal partners in society, although the structure of society is Hiver generated, and those races able to adapt best to the Hiver way of life and customs have been most successful. All races participate in the embassies, although in a modified form.

Some associate species retain strong internal governments or police forces to regulate the aggressive tendencies of their members, but whatever solution is reached, all Federation member societies are nonaggressive.

Most worlds of the Federation have communities of several species; races inhabit the worlds they find most pleasant.

Holiday Year

The year zero in the history of the Third Imperium, decreed by Cleon I to commemorate the establishment of the Imperium. Technically an aspect of calendar reform, the use of the year zero provides a central date point for counting years back into the Long Night and forward into the future of the Imperium.

The actual advantages of a holiday year are slight: centuries begin in the hundredth numbered year instead of the first numbered year, and the number of years between any two dates can be determined by subtraction.

More importantly at the time, the holiday year was used as part of the public relations campaigns which were impressing the authority of the Imperium upon local governments. The minor requirement of changing to the new calendar was used to determine the cooperation by those governments.

Hortalez et Cie
LIC

Founded in 221 by Lucienne Hortalez, capitalised from family funds. Primarily a banking and investment house, Hortalez specializes in loans to planetary governments, mercenary unit bonding, underwriting of large scale projects of all sorts, and other fiscal activities. Hortalez is one of the major insurance houses in the Imperium. In some regions (especially the Spinward Marches) the firm acts as a mercenary clearing house.

Howood

Extremely dense, striated material obtained from the trunk of the Howood tree, a rare plant native to Pretoria (Deneb/Pretoria) and known to grow on several similar worlds in the Spinward Marches. The tree concentrates metals from the soil in their extremely tough bark. Howood is aromatic and its scent is especially pleasing to Vargr. It is also beautiful; the size, colors, and intensities of its rings and striations vary unpredictably with the characteristics of the environment in which the plant grows.

Humaniti

Collective name for the human races, including the Solomani, Vilani, Zhodani, and others. Former spelling Humanity.

Humans

Intelligent major race dominating the Imperium, the Zhodani Consulate, the Solomani Confederation, and several additional interstellar communities. Humans stand approximately 1.7 meters in height and weigh about 100 kg. Descended from omnivore gatherers, humans developed intelligence in response to shifting climatological factors.

The most unusual aspect of Humaniti is the fact that Humans are present on many different worlds and stand at various levels of development on these worlds. The Solomani Hypothesis states that Humans evolved on Terra (Solomani Rim/Sol) and were scattered to many different worlds by the Ancients for reasons currently unknown. The result is that many different and parallel human races exist and coexist throughout known space.

The three most widespread human races are the Solomani (Humans from Terra), the Vilani (humans from Vland), and the Zhodani (humans from Zhodane).

Imperial Calendar

The Imperial Calendar was established at the creation of the Third Imperium as a universal calendar reform. Dates count from the founding of the Imperium, the year-"zero". Dates before zero are negative, dates after are positive. For example, Terra discovered jump drive in -2431. The Imperium was founded in zero. Emperor Strephon was crowned in 1071. The year is divided into 365 standard days, which are grouped in 52 weeks of seven days each. The lengths of days and weeks is a legacy of Terran domination during the second Imperium. Days are numbered consecutively, beginning with one. The first day of the year is a holiday and is not part of any week. For example, the first day of the twelfth century of the Imperium (holiday) is 001-1100.

Imperial Edict 97

This executive order is the enabling act for the use of Imperial warrants. Unusually obscure for such a wide ranging and powerful edict, it is nonetheless on file at all Imperial installations. The edict runs to 34 pages, much of it pure legalese; when distilled down, it proves very direct: an order to assist the bearer of an Imperial warrant with all the power you can bring to bear. Only the emperor has the power to issue these warrants. A similar edict (edict 3097) provides limited power to the Archdukes of the Imperium to issue similar warrants, although they are limited in their duration and territory.

Imperial Guard

Eleven regiments of highly trained, superbly equipped troops dedicated to the protection of the Emperor and the Imperial Palace. Accepted as one of the elite formations of the Imperial armed forces, the Imperial Guard is a respected unit with a long and honored tradition. One purpose of the Imperial guard is to provide a symbol of political unity for the Imperium. One Regiment is drawn from each of the seven Domains of the Imperium, with each serving a one month tour of duty as honor regiment in rotation.

Imperial Research

The worlds of the Imperium manifest a wide range of technological levels. The Third Imperium has always allowed its member worlds a wide degree of latitude, and it meddles very little in local affairs. With communication limited to the same speed as transportation, a single offworld query can involve weeks, months, or even years before a reply is received. ln addition, the cost of offworld transportation (both in time and money) tends to limit the interchange of information, the shipment of experimental prototypes and other such activities that are basic to the dissemination of scientific knowledge. Most worlds have found that simply purchasing advanced technology from a neighboring world is impractical. Not only is such high technology expensive, putting it to any cost effective use requires that the technology be understood. Consider: as useful as Tech Level 8 solid-state chip circuits are, they cannot be used on a large scale without the knowledge of electronics or the ability to provide supporting circuits (power circuits, circuit boards, and so on), which further implies knowledge of photoprocessing, and even crystal culture. In the final analysis, attempting to jump to a higher Tech Level without passing through any of the intervening Tech Levels just doesn't work; one must pass through the lower stages of technological development on the way to the higher Tech Level. Regardless of what the individual member worlds do, there are also certain large-scale interests in the Imperium which back research projects. Such research is generally privately backed (such as under contract by multiworld corporations), or it is sometimes performed in established Imperial Research Stations.

Imperial Rules of War

To mitigate most of the potentially disastrous aspects of armed conflict, the "rules of war" evolved as an accumulation of unwritten concepts, which were established on a case-by-case basis. The rules of war have never been officially codified, both to prevent them being seen as an Imperial endorsement of war and to keep formal precedent from preventing Imperial intervention whenever the Imperium deemed it necessary. The main aim of the rules is maintaining the economic and military well-being of the realm. They give the Imperium the right to intervene only when local military action threatened this well-being. The primary causes of instability, as viewed by Imperial analysts, have been long-term economic dislocation and excessive extraplanetary influence.

A) long-term social or economic dislocation is suffered when a region loses its ability to carry on at its prewar level of activity.

B) Excessive extraplanetary influence is even more vague. Historically, the Imperium has tolerated the use of force as a necessary outlet for built-up political and social pressures. In such cases, a short war is deemed preferable to continuing tension, sabotage, political agitation, etc. However, attempts by extraplanetary forces, such as offworld governments or large commercial interests, to seize control of a world's affairs are beyond the scope of the "safety valve" rationale.

For example, the Imperium tolerates mercenary forces  which have been hired by local governments or other on-planet powers. It has even tolerated the provision of training cadre, arms, equipment, and so on (on a limited scale) by megacorporations , and even of fully-equipped striker units to local forces. However, when it has appeared that the primary burden for the conduct of the war has been carried out by an extra-planetary power, the Imperium has intervened, claiming the power is using the misfortune of a local dispute as a pretext for aggression.

"Assistance" is tolerated so long as it is deemed appropriate to the level of legitimate interest in the affairs of the world held by the extraplanetary organization. For example, the Imperium has often tolerated the provision by megacorporations of providing training cadre, arms equipment, etc. on a limited scale, and even of training fully equipped striker units to local governments. However, when it appeared that the primary burden for the conduct of the war has been carried by an extraplanetary power, the Imperium has intervened, claiming the power is using the misfortune of a local dispute as a pretext for aggression.

Unlike the above rules, one prohibition is clear and firm throughout the Imperium: the use or possession of nuclear weapons of any type.

Imperial Stationary

The Imperial family has reserved (both by custom and by law) a distinctive design for its personal stationary. Well-known throughout the Imperium through its use for routine messages and for Imperial appointments, the form is cream colored and embossed with the Imperial Sunburst in gold. Both physical and electronic versions of the stationary are used.

Because it is used for Imperial appointments (even when issued blank for office use) all Imperial officials are familiar with the design and can readily tell physical forgeries from the real thing. Electronic versions are data encrypted with a special code lock and require a special hardware key to be unlocked, thus making even electronic forgeries difficult.

^^^^

Imperial Sunburst

The symbol of the Third Imperium established by Cleon (the first emperor) when the empire was proclaimed. Images show him standing before the original banner with a golden yellow sunburst against a black background, representing Capital's G-type star against black space. In 247, the Eliyoh (a nonhuman minor race) joined the Imperium. To that race the symbology was unimpressive. The Eliyoh vision centered in the far infra red, which resulted in distinction between the official colors of yellow and black being impossible. So Empress Porfiria declared that the symbol would have no official color. The original banner in the Imperial throne room is still black with a yellow sunburst. The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service uses a red sunburst; the Imperial Navy yellow; the Imperial Army black; the Imperial Marines maroon.

^^^^

Imperial Warrant

Instrument of power issued by the Emperor, or Imperial Dukes and Archdukes (to lesser extent). A warrant is a written or electronic document on Imperial stationary provided to trusted agents of the Imperium as a method of bypassing the bureaucracy.

Typically, a warrant is provided to an individual who uses the power it provides to accomplish some mission of interest to the issuing official. Missions may include establishment of colonies in areas requiring development, the assumption of military command in the midst of a crisis, and the unilateral establishment of new noble lines to administer provinces which have suffered from war or economic collapse.

For example, Emperor Strephon sometimes exercises his power through agents rather than directly through the bureaucracy of the Imperium. These instances are rare, although there is reason to believe that such agents are more numerous than it appears.

Interdiction

The Imperial practice of interdiction of worlds within the boundaries of the Imperium had long been a source of contention between liberal and conservative factions in the government. Interdictions must be approved by a member of the Imperial family, but generally such approval is given in response to a request from an interested service, which is almost always the Scouts or the Navy.

It is generally held that the Scouts recommend interdiction to shield a young or sensitive culture from the interference that trade and commerce will bring.

The Navy is held to be more vindictive in its recommendations, for they use interdiction to punish local governments or to hide its own mistakes.

Interdicted worlds are classed as having type-X starports . The Traveller's Aid Society generally awards interdicted worlds Red Travel Zone ratings.

Instellarms
LIC

Founded in 626, shortly after the end of the Civil War, by Axel Murdoch, a retired colonel of mercenaries. Taking advantage of inside contacts in the Imperial military, Murdoch was able to obtain large quantities of surplus military equipment at very low prices, but still costing billions of credits. Where Murdoch got his financing is not known.

Murdoch's connections with various mercenary unit commanders coupled with a willingness to ignore the Imperial regulations on mercenary warfare where profits were large enough enabled Instellarms to dominate the mercenary arms trade in the coreward sectors of the Imperium within ninety years, and in the Imperium as a whole within two centuries.

Manufacturing, buying, and selling military equipment of all sorts, Instellarms is a specialty supplier of mercenary units of all sizes and types. Agents of the firm can often be found on a battlefield, negotiating
the purchase of the equipment of the losing side before the battle is completely over. The company does not deal in interstellar vessels and chemical, bacteriological, or nuclear weaponry.

Julian War
(175 to 191)

A war initiated by the Imperium, under Emperor Martin I, to annex the sectors of Meshan, Mendan, and Amdukan. After nine years of negotiation and diplomatic manoeuvering with the many confederations of the area (each a member of a larger confederation), Martin mobilized the Imperial Navy against these states. In the first three years of the war, Imperial fleets pushed deep into ,lendan sector, capturing the capital world of Lasla and several important industrial worlds. In 178, however, a minor bureaucrat in the government of the capital of a confederation in Amdukan sector had risen to power there and gathered around himself an alliance of neighboring confederations. This bureaucrat then proposed a defensive confederation encompassing all three sectors under attack.

This state, the Julian Protectorate (named for its founder), fought sporadic battles, doing its best to push back the Imperial fleets. Then, in 185, concentrated Protectorate fleets crossed the Lesser Rift in an end run against Antares, and with deep raids against the Imperial Depots in Antares and Ley sectors. With two local depots destroyed, the Imperium withdrew its fleets to protect its internal communication lines.

The Protectorate fleets then concentrated on the Antares cluster, a lightly defended group of worlds, which fell easily to their advances. Using these worlds as a base, the forces of the Protectorate carried the war into the Imperium. In 190 the Imperium lost several battles in attempting to retake the Antares cluster, and Martin I became convinced that the Protectorate could not be pressed into the Imperium, and gave up the fight. However, the war did not end there, as the Protectorate insisted on keeping a hand in the Antares cluster. The peace treaty included the establishment of the League of Antares as a compromise, ending the war in 191 on the Protectorate's terms.

Jump Dimming

The transitions to and from jump space are momentous occasions during an interstellar trip. Following an old Vilani superstition, the pilot of a ship customarily dims the ship's interior and exterior lights before going into jump. Historically, this custom derived from the need for most of the ship's power to be diverted into the computer and jump drive systems, so that the jump drive can be guided into creating the jump field properly. Zhodani and Solomani pilots do not follow this tradition of 'jump dimming'.

Lights on a ship are typically dimmed for a period of about two minutes; the lights are brought back up to full strength as soon as the ship is in jumpspace.

^^^^

Jump Drive

The combination of equipment required to insert a starship into jumpspace and project a jump field. This consists of four components: A high-yield fusion powerplant which energizes the second component an energy sink array (usually constructed of Zuchai Crystals); when the jump point is reached this energy is transferred to a jump grid (usually of lanthanum) on the ships' hull under the control of a jump governor. The jump governor is a computer controlled device which energizes the grid in a sequence determined by the jump to be undertaken.

Jumpspace

The basic concept of interstellar travel: that of an alternate space. Theoretically, jumpspaces are alternate spaces, each only dimly understood from the standpoint of our own universe. Jump is defined as the movement of matter from one point in space (called normal space) to another in normal space by travelling through an alternate space (called jumpspace). The benefit of jump is that the time required is relatively invariant, about one week. If the distance travelled is greater than can be covered in one week in normal space, then a gain has been made. Jumpspace makes possible enormous gains.

Jump is the term used to describe the movement of matter from one point in normal space (N-space) to another point in normal space by travelling through a different plane of existence, called jumpspace (J-space).

Normal space (N-space) consists of 4 dimensions; 3 of space and 1 of time. The era of modern physics dawned with the realisation that there are more dimensions than these; modern cosmology places the number at no less than 62. Most of these do not affect us, as they are only in force at the sub-atomic level, while the remaining 36 are accessable only by jump drive.

The various jumpspace dimensions are described by modern physicists as the "levels" of jumpspace. Each level has its own character, defined by the physical laws which operate there: these laws are known as the "weave". A level's weave ranges from very "loose" (easy to enter) to very "tight" (difficult to enter). Currently, we can only access 6 jumpspace levels, each of which is associated with an approximate distance travelled in parsecs. For example, a ship making a three-parsec jump is travelling through "level three jumpspace". The higher the level number, the tighter the weave. To date, only misjumps have encountered jumpspace level seven or higher.

Jump drives are also rated in parsecs; jump-1, for instance, indicates an ability to jump 1 parsec (that is, enter level one jumpspace). The jump drive opens the weave and tumbles the ship into and through a tunnel in the selected jumpspace level. The jumpspace tunnel is mathematically similar to an artificially created wormhole. Due to the unique topology of jumpspace, the "fall" through the tunnel takes about 1 standard week (150 to 185 hours), regardless of the distance travelled in N-space. If the distance travelled is greater than can be covered in one week in normal space, then a gain has been made. This time spent in the jumpspace tunnel is referred to as time "in the hole" by experienced travellers.

Ships in jump are untouchable and out of communication. Jumps are usually made at low velocities, because ships leaving jumpspace retain the speed and direction they held prior to jump. Minimum mass for entry into jumpspace is 100 tons.

Entering jumpspace is possible anywhere, but gravity perturbations make it safest to begin a jump at least 100 diameters from a star or a world. Jumps made between 10 and 100 diameters are considered hazardous and should be avoided. Jumps from within 10 diameters are often disastrous.

Oddly enough, ships cannot materialise in a gravity well. Any craft whose jump vector calls for it to break into N-space within 100 diameters is precipitated violently out of jumpspace. In some cases, this can cause severe damage to the ship or its crew.


Normal jumps take 168 hours (plus or minus 10 percent) to complete, regardless of the distance travelled.

Sometimes a jump goes wrong. Catastrophic failures (called misjumps) can destroy the ship and its crew. Other failures can destroy a drive or send a ship in the wrong direction. Some misjumps reduce a jump-6 to a mere jump-1, or convert a jump-1 into jump-10, 20, or higher.

Kirur
(Ruupiin/Thirty 1315 B863A03-F)

Homeworld and capital of the Two Thousand Worlds, the interstellar empire of the K'kree. The planet's oceans are extremely shallow and the world exhibits almost no volcanic activity, which is very unusual for a world of its size. Kirur has one large continent, which was conquered in prehistoric times by the current ruling clan; Kirur is one of the most politically stable planets known.

^^^^

K'kree

The K'kree (once called Centaurs by humans) are among the most massive of the major races and are the only one of the major races to be descended from herbivores. An adult K'kree stands about 1.5 meters at the shoulder and between 2.0 and 2.4 meters tall when standing erect. Weight averages 550 kg. They are bilaterally symmetrical, hexapedal, and homeothermic. They bear some resemblance to the centaur of ancient Terran myth, a trait noted by the earliest human explorers.

The arrangement of the manipulative organ (or hand) on the front limb is one of their most interesting features. Complex cartilaginous tubes permit the fingers of the K'kree hand to telescope out of the way when the hand is used as a weapon. Fully extended, the fingers are mutually opposable to each other and to the "thumb" which is in reality an extension of the ulna. The K'kree hand is very flexible but somewhat weaker in grasping power than a human hand.

The K'kree are covered with short gray or black fur and a dense black mane covering the head and neck and upper back of both sexes. Unlike Terran mammals, the young are fed partially digested, regurgitated food instead of milk. Males average 15 percent to 20 percent larger than females.

K'kree are extremely conservative in all aspects of their culture. Ceremonial military units (such as bodyguards) are armed with equipment which K'kree military technology outdated centuries ago, and (aside from modifications made necessary by the discovery of space flight) K'kree government has not changed significantly in centuries.

Because of their origins as plains-dwelling herd animals, the K'kree are claustrophobes; they cannot stand to be enclosed.

K'kree cities are clumps of low, broad buildings; the interior is never more than one story in height, which allows the sky to be visible. Internal building divisions are achieved with curtains and tapestries.

K'kree are extremely gregarious. They are never found alone, and will quickly sicken and die if removed from other K'kree for any length of time. Receiving a trade or diplomatic delegation from the K'kree means entertaining the entire family (one or more wives, servants, scribes, assistants, etc.) of the merchant or ambassador. The K'kree word for "my" refers to a possession of an individual's herd, not to that of an individual. Privacy and individuality are exotic and little understood concepts for K'kree.

Society: K'kree society is divided into castes. The system is a remnant of ancient times which no longer fits K'kree culture perfectly, but the K'kree stick with it because it is traditional. There are hundreds of castes, but distinctions are too faint for non-K'kree to understand. For simplicity, castes can be divided into three general groupings: noble, merchant, and servants. It is possible for a family to rise in caste, but this is a rare occurrence.

The lowest caste, the servants, has come to include farmers, factory workers and unskilled laborers as well as servants for all classes.

The next higher caste, the merchants, includes most skilled workers, scientists, engineers, technicians, scribes and government administrators, as well as merchants and businessmen.

Nobles are the governmental officials (the Krurruna and others), the high military officers, diplomats, and heads of trade and manufacturing concerns. Nobles are usually garbed in much more ornate fashion than the lower castes.

Every male K'kree must serve a term in the military upon coming of age. Warriors are drawn from all castes; rank in the military is determined by caste of origin. Upon completing the required term of service, a warrior returns to his original caste and position. Warriors are the only K'kree permitted to bear weapons, and they are further distinguished by their peculiar flared and horned helmets. They serve as soldiers, police, firefighters, and bodyguards for diplomatic and mercantile expeditions.

Female K'kree are casteless, and take on the caste of their father or husband. Females have no position in government or society other than the rearing of young.

Government
The basis of K'kree government is rooted in the traditional herd system. The basic unit of government is the herd, which consists of thousands of individuals of all castes and ages led by Krurruna (literally: bosses) under a single steppelord.

In recent times, most herds have been assigned specific geographic areas (several may be assigned to city or a single herd may be assigned millions of hectares of farmland). A number of herds are governed by a single "lord of steppelordes" (usually the ruler of a planet); and the K'kree race as a whole is ruled by a "Steppelord of the 2000 Worlds".

K'kree Calendar

The K'kree calendar is based on the period of Kirur (the K'kree homeworld) around Gzang, it's star. The K'kree Pim!bigr (year) is 439.56 standard days in length.

(Provence/Grnouf 2402 A8859B9-F)

"Homeworld" and capital of the Vargr Extents. Lair has never been accorded any particular status in the hearts and minds of the Vargr race, unlike worlds like Terra, Vland, Zhodane, Kuzu or Kirur. Lair was only recently united; several sections of the planet boasted independence until only a few years ago - which is unusual for the home world of a major interstellar race.

Lancia

Cultural region in the Gushemege sector of the Third Imperium. The area was extensively ravaged during the Vilani Pacification Campaigns and afterwards resettled from the Vland sector under a special program sponsored by Makhidkarun.

Lanthanum

A rare earth element, the first of the inner transition metals. Vital to the construction of the inner coils of interstellar jump drive units.

League of Suns

Imperial client state in the Jungleblut subsector of the Far Frontiers sector. Originally formed by a group of planets rebelling againt the Dominion of Alntzar in 819, the League has provided a stable island of peace and prosperity in the region for the past 300 years. The League is a loose coalition of worlds with governmental functions centered at Alzenei/Jungleblut. Treaty arrangements with the Imperium provide for Imperial use of local facilities for ships and sauadrons operating in the area in exchange for support against encroachment by surrounding Zhodani clients (including the remnant of the Dominion). 

A peaceful state the League's primary interstellar enforcement arm is the League Survey Service, a scout organization with military appendages. Most bases, except for that on Kokkelen, are strictly Scout operation centers. Kokkelen Base is home to the LSS naval arm, which has been stationed on Kokkelen for most of the League's history ans a check against Alntzar. Recent problems with the Descarothe Hegemony, however, have led to plans to update the scout base on Alzenei to co-equal status.

Lesser Rift

Broad Expanse of space with a very low density of stars trailing the main region of the Third Imperium. This rift is a pronounced impediment to interstellar travel, for it constrains jumps through the Empty Quarter. The Lesser Rift, like the Great Rift, has provided long term security for the Third Imperium by constraining access to the Imperiums Boarders.

Llellewylolly

Sophont race native to Junidy (Spinward Marches/Aramis 3202 B434ABD-9). Llellewyloly have five multi jointed limbs which function as hands and feet interchangeably; main sensory organs are also located on the limbs. The spherical central body is covered with long, coarse hair. Many body features are adaptations to the extreme temperature variations of Junidy's day.

Llellewyloly have a complex society with many dimensions of social precedence; the same individual may be entitled to high status in one situation and low status in another, and to make an error concerning propriety is a serious matter.

^^^^

Loeskalth

Minor human race from Gushemege sector; known only from ancient First Imperium records. During the early stages of the First Imperium the Loeskalth culture absorbed a great deal of science and technology indirectly from the Vilani and founded a small empire which embraced, at its height, most of their home subsector.

About 5400 years ago, the Vilani consolidation destroyed the Loeskalth Empire and absorbed the civilization into the mainstream of Vilani culture. An aggressive and warlike race, the Loeskalth resisted but were ultimately overwhelmed.

Lydia
(b.1052)

Princess of the Imperium, daughter of Emperor Paulo III, sister to Emperor Strephon. A naval officer, Princess Lydia carries out many of the formal duties of the Imperial Family with regard to the Imperial Armed Forces. She and her husband, Duke Dresden, also tour Naval facilities throughout the Imperium, presenting decorations and nobility patents on behalf of the Emperor. Born three years after her brother, the Princess is second in line to the throne.

Main

A large grouping of systems forming a chain of worlds all within jump-l of another. This grouping provides a sort of "corridor" allowing jump-l capable ships to travel to any world along the chain without ever exceeding jump-l.

Many such groupings exist in the Imperium. Prominent examples include the Spinward Main in the Spinward Marches, the Vilani Main centered in the Vland sector, the Sylean Main in Core sector, and Antares Main originating in the Antares sector.

Major Race

An arbitrary distinction based on the achievements of a specific intelligent race. A race which achieves interstellar travel (jump drive) through its own efforts is classed major; one which does not is classed minor.

To date, generally accepted major races include Humaniti, (Zhodani, Solomani, and Vilani, but not other examples), Aslan, the Hive, K'kree, Vargr, Ancients, and Droyne.

The Suerrat (a human race) are considered minor because their achievement of interstellar travel utilized generation Ships. Similarly, the Geonee were originally thought to be major race, but their development of jump drive was based on recovered Ancient artifacts rather than on true racial efforts. The Geonee dispute this prevailing opinion and hold the (generally unshared) view that they are of major standing.

The Droyne have been demonstrated to be major, for they have developed jump drive as far back as -7000. At present, however, they do not build or use jump drives, and remain voluntarily sequestered in their scattered systems to spinward.

Makhidkarun

The origins of this company are shrouded in the mists of the Long Night. All that can be stated with certainty is that its foundation pre-dates the Third Imperium. Makhidkarun specializes in the communications and entertainment industries. The firm produces fine musical recordings of all types, two and three dimensional motion pictures, books, magazines, and art reproductions of all sorts. Its communications division produces a wide variety of data processing, storage, and retrieval equipment and the requisite software, along with various innovative robotics technologies. A gourmet foods division trades in all manner of rare and expensive foods, wines and delicacies. In the Spinward Marches, Makhidkarun has manufacturing and purchasing facilities spread throughout the sector, and also has extensive holdings through its transport subsidiary, Arean Transport. This line's routes travel across the sector and beyond into Foreven and Far Frontiers sectors; its starships (including the famous liner, King Richard) are renowned for their luxury.

Stock ownership: Imperial family- 5%, Noble families- 28%, Hortalez et Cie- 28%, Investment trusts- 25%, Private ownership- 14%.

Marches Auxiliary Naval Service

In a border area such as the Spinward Marches, the IISS is responsible for exploration and survey in all the surrounding sectors. Thus, the mapping services provided to the navy in other areas of the Imperium is not up to standard in this area. To deal with this problem, MANS was established. Staffed by people from every type of service background, the Service carries out various survey, exploration, and reconnaissance missions, with a greater emphasis on the military importance of the information gained. The Service also provides several specialized scout squadrons to the Navy during war time.

Margaret

Duchess of Delphi, first cousin, once removed to the Emperor Strephon. Margaret lives far from the social whirl of Capital, preferring the position of sector duchess at the head of the local hierarchy, instead of competing with nobles of similar precedence at the Imperial court. She recently married Count Blaine Trulla Tukera, assuring her of wealth and him of influence, and placing them at the pinnacle of society across two sectors.

^^^^

Mars

Popular term for the Mars Shipwrights, Gravengineers and Computertechs Union, a shipbuilding concern based on Mora (Mora/Spinward Marches 0704) and owning subsidiary yards on Maitz and Pallique. Named for its founder, Marcus Alexander Rameo Serenpindo, and the three major industrial unions amalgamated at its formation. In its earliest days, it concentrated solely on merchant vessels, and is widely considered responsible for the success of many Moran based merchant trade companies across the sector. Although the home yard on Mora caters almost exclusively to naval and scout construction contracts, the two auxiliary shipyards still produce merchants as a large proportion of their total output. Many of the Subsidized and Free merchant operations in the Marches use Mars vessels.

Megacorporation

An extremely large interstellar corporation. When a corporation's scope of operations are such that it provides services to an area similar to that controlled by Imperial government, it earns the name megacorporation. Only thirteen such companies exist within the Imperium, along with another thirteen based in other interstellar states.

Because of their size, megacorporations have truly astronomical numbers of employees, shareholders, and profits. Their upper level executives labor at broad policy questions, and are largely out of contact with the day-to-day (and even year-to-year) activities of the corporation. The real power in the company lies in the hands of the regional managers (under whatever title they have) Who control the actual operations of the business. While they may control only a small fraction of the megacorporation's assets, they wield more power in some areas than do the representatives of the Imperial government.

A small number of Imperial regulatory agencies have power over the megacorporations, and the companies are subject to any applicable local taxes as well. Nevertheless, if Imperial sovereignty is not blatantly violated, regional managers can usually conduct their company' s business as they see fit.

Staggering in size, these organisations are so large that no one person can know everything they are concerned with at any given moment. Total shares of stock, annual profits, number of employees are all astronomical. Many are so large that different divisions of the same megacorporation can be working at cross-purposes. In most regions, megacorporations merely own the land their installations are located on; however, in some areas they control entire planets, either directly or indirectly. Their brands, trade names, and service marks have come to be universally recognised throughout the Imperium and beyond.

Most megacorporations are organised like smaller companies, with a board of directors, a president, and vice-presidents. However, the board and the higher-level executive officers of the company are largely out of touch with the day-to-day (or even year-to-year) functioning of the company. They only plan general policy and a few long-distance actions.

The most important executives, in terms of personal power, are the various regional managers (by whatever name they may be called). A regional manager may only control a small portion of a megacorporation's total assets, but may hold more power in some regions than the local representatives of the Imperial government. Provided they do not blatantly violate Imperial soverignty, regional managers can usually conduct their company's business as they see fit. A small number of Imperial regulatory agencies have power over megacorporations, and megacorporations are subject to local taxes. A direct confrontation with the Imperium would be bad for business, so intentional violation of Imperial laws is done only on a covert basis.

Only a very few commercial enterprises grow large enough to extend their activities to every corner of the Imperium. In fact, there are only thirteen megacorporations within the Imperium. It is difficult for a company to grow to the size of a megacorporation unless it has the protection of a suitably-sized government.

Some of the interstellar empires surrounding the Imperium have grown to the size that they can also support megacorporations. In addition to those within the Imperium, there are another thirteen megacorporations operating in the adjoining territories. In comparison, the largest of these is perhaps median-sized when compared with an Imperial megacorporation; the smallest is smaller than any of the Imperial companies.

All corporations engaging in interstellar commerce are required to possess an Imperial Charter . This is indicated by the letters "LIC" (Limited Imperial Charter) following the company name. Occasionally, corporations make use of old titles, such as Ltd, Inc, AG, SA, etc. This is done to indicate that the company pre-dates the Third Imperium (rarely the case) or to add quaintness and charm to the title.

A few Vilani megacorporations are still in business under their Vilani titles: Makhidkarun , Naasirka , Sharurshid, and Zirunkariish . These names, at least, date back to the First Imperium, and were the names of the Vilani organisations - half industrial trusts, half government bureaus - which controlled commerce in the Vilani Imperium.

The thirteen megacorporations within the Imperium are:

Name Major Interests

Delgado Trading, LIC Military hardware, mining, publishing. 
General Products, LIC Heavy industry, starships. 
GSbAG Starships. 
Hortalez et Cie, LIC Banking and investment.

Mercenary

The remote centralized government of the Imperium is possessed of great industrial and technological might, but it is also unable, due to the sheer distances and travel times involved, to exert total control everywhere within its starspanning realm. Extensive home rule provisions allow planets to choose their own forms of government, raise and maintain their own armed forces for local security, pass and enforce laws governing local conduct, and regulate (within limits) commerce. Defense has been a cooperative effort of local indigenous forces, which is stiffened by Imperial naval bases manned by extremely sophisticated forces.

Conflicting local interests have often settled their Differences by force of arms, with Imperial forces looking quietly the other way, unable to intervene en masse. Imperial forces have been unable to operate as a police force so as to not jeopardize their primary mission of defense of the realm. Only when local conflicts threaten the security or the economy of an area have Imperial forces taken an active hand, and then with overwhelming speed and force.

In this environment, the soldier for hire has found active employment. The tolerance exhibited by the forces of the Imperium have made the hired military force a practical matter. Imperial policy has allowed the marketplace to provide military force to those who can afford it; one line of thought has been that a hired military can be more effectively controlled if it gets out of hand, as opposed to nationalistic or politically motivated forces .

Merchant Cruiser

A generic term applied to vessels specifically assigned to independent missions, the prime objective of which is market discovery and acquisition, either in isolation or in competition with other merchant operators. Design parameters for such vessels usually include a high level of weaponry and auxiliary boats in proportion to their cargo capacity and all possible back-up systems, along with high structural integrity.

^^^^

Minor Race

An intelligent race which has not achieved jump drive through its own efforts. For most races, this classification is appropriate. Many are contacted before they have reached a technological level capable of even considering jump drive, thus permanently prejudicing their potential.

Indeed, the shock of such a classification, and the realization that this classification pervades interstellar society, is sufficient to relegate a race to a permanent role as shopkeepers and accountants. Some slump, while others violently resist the classification. The fact that the categorization is informal and arbitrary, and tends to elevate those already in power has made resistance difficult, if not impossible.

Monadium

Impenetrable bluish-gray metal used as the basic construction material by the Ancients at the site on Antiquity (Corridor/Ian 0816). It has defeated all efforts to determine its exact composition; some experts believe it contains titanium. Even modern tech level 15 plasma and fusion weapons have been unable to penetrate it.

^^^^

Moot

The Imperial government's only deliberative body. It has few powers and rarely exercises them. In theory, the Moot includes all Imperial nobles of baronial or higher status, but most nobles do not find it convenient to travel to Capital, and so many of those seated hold proxy votes. Large blocks of these votes can be wielded by a single influential noble.

Technically, the Moot is supreme in the Imperium, but its power is extremely limited. In practice, its deliberations are advisory to the emperor, and he is wise to heed them. The Moot has only one power; to dissolve the Imperium. When this power is brought to bear, it compels compromise between opposing factions.

When an emperor dies, abdicates, or otherwise becomes unfit for office, the Moot becomes important as the validating body for the new emperor. It has the power to examine the qualifications and credentials of the heir apparent and, in unusual situations, to reject him.

The Moot holds its sessions in the Moot Spire, which, at 1.75 kilometers High, is the tallest building on Capital. By tradition, the Spire is the only building allowed to tower above the Imperial Palace, which is 4.25 kilometers away. Elevators with gravitic compensators can speed visitors from bottom to top in 18 seconds. At the top of the Spire is the High Moot, where select committees hold the most private deliberations.

^^^^

Naasirka

Naasirka specializes in the manufacture of information storage and processing equipment and software, computers, and other complex electronic devices. Their robots are the most commonly found of any company within the Imperium. The firm is a Vilani megacorporation of uncertain lineage, but it is known to have been in business prior to the founding of the Sylean Federation. Naasirka is the largest supplier of communications equipment to the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service's X-boat branch.

Naasirka was a late-comer to the Spinward Marches; until recent expansions, it owned only a few facilities on the sector's trailing border, such as the shipyard on Aramis (Spinward Marches/Aramis 0710), and robotics factories on Rhylanor.

Naasirka is the largest robot manufacturer in the Imperium. Its robots rarely use innovative technology, but their aggressive marketing staff has placed more robots than either Makhidkarun or LSP, Naasirka's two largest competitors. Old Naasirka introduced the Rashush line of robots, the first non-military line, 200 years after the Rule of Man was established. It is still marketed today. Naasirka retails a standard model TL 15 servant robot with INT 5 and an EDU 1 for Cr77,500. Its useful life is 85 years.

Naasirka was a Vilani megacorporation, in business prior to the founding of the Sylean Federation . Beyond that, Naasirka has an uncertain lineage.

Interests: Information retrieval hardware and software, robots, electronics.

Home Port: Tauri ( Vland / Vland 1817).

Stock ownership: Imperial family- 4% Investment trusts- 24%, Noble families- 23%, Hortalez et Cie- 11%, Other corporations 14% Igsiirdi family- 13%, Private ownership- 11%.

Naasirka Endowment

A high tech scientific establishment which combines hands-on research with educational internships. Areas of interest include computer hardware and software. Although the administrative offices are on Vland ( Vland / Vland 1717), internships are sponsored throughout the Imperium.

The endowment, as can be deduced by its name, is sponsored by Naasirka.

Naval Base

Port facility for the support, maintenance, repair, and refit of naval vessels. Planetary surface facilities are generally provided for vessels of 1000 tons or less; orbital facilities handle larger ships.

A naval base has several distinct parts to it; each part helps in the accomplishment of the overall mission of the base. The typical naval base is composed of an orbital berthing area, a surface berthing area, a maintenance section, and an administrative headquarters. Berthing areas provide locations for ships to lay over, for a day or for months. All berthing areas include provisions for refueling from storage tanks or fuel lighters.

Maintenance sections at naval bases vary from base to base. Where such a section would be redundant to the local starport shipyard, it is small, and repairs or alterations are carried out under contract by the local facility. Where adequate facilities do not exist, the naval base itself may have a large maintenance section capable of extensive repairs and refits. Maintenance is performed on ships on the world surface or in orbit as necessary.

The administrative headquarters handles the day-to-day operations of the base, as well as its paperwork (including allocation of funds, distribution of personnel, and disbursement of maintenance and repair contracts). The naval base is not a tactical unit. It has no battle forces of its own, and it does not exert control even over local system defense boats (which are under a separate command). The naval base is responsible for supporting the
fleet and Keeping it in optimum condition for its combat missions.

^^^^

Naval Depot

Main support base for the Imperial Navy and hub of its support and supply system. The navy maintains a network of 19 depots to support its fleets, generally one per sector. Depots are placed in systems where they will be close enough to the expected action to be useful, but far enough back to ensure that they will not be captured.

A naval depot is a huge harbouring area for starships, naval personnel, and supporting services. It typically occupies an entire system and thus has unlimited starship berths. It is designed and stocked so that it can withstand isolation from outside contact for years at a time. Facilities, materiel, and personnel are extensive enough to repair and resupply a large fraction of the fleet simultaneously. It provides construction and repair facilities, and produces and tests experimental ship prototypes. In short, a naval depot is the focus of the Imperial Navy's system of bases .

A naval depot provides three distinct types of services to the ships of the Imperial Navy: ship services, personnel services, and training.

The main task of a naval depot is to provide ship services to the Navy. For ships in service, these include periodic inspections, annual overhauls, repairs of operational damage, and upgrades to new equipment. In addition, these cover the design, construction and testing of new ships. Depots keep on hand a stock of repair and replacement parts that would be unavailable at any one place anywhere else in the Imperium. In wartime, the main task is to repair battle-damaged ships and return them to service. In peacetime, the main task is the design, construction, and testing of ships. A large staff of naval architects (the cream of the area) and construction personnel is maintained at every depot. In emergencies, the depot's construction yards can be pressed into service for production of military ships.

Depots are a natural assignment for large numbers of naval personnel. Any skill required by the Navy can be found at a depot. Support services, administration, dependant support, housing, recreation, and technical services are all needed on a continuing basis at the depot. With such a large staff available, a depot becomes a natural replacement centre, providing crew rotation and replacement from its own assets as needed.

Each depot is also given the task of providing training for naval personnel. The many services provided by the depot make it uniquely suited to train personnel for those services. As a result, a depot maintains an extensive training establishment, providing in depth training for all aspects of starship technology.

Since a depot is obviously a very sensitive installation, security is tight. An extensive array of both entry and exit codes are employed to ensure no unauthorised vessels enter or leave the system. Contingents of marines and SDBs are stationed throughout the system, and are constantly ready for action.

Depots serve as focuses for naval efforts: supplying a fleet's every need, providing construction and repair facilities, and producing and testing experimental ship prototypes. A depot generally occupies an entire system. Facilities, material, and personnel are extensive enough to repair and resupply a large fraction of the fleet at any time. A depot may be isolated from outside contact for years at a time without serious setbacks. As depots cover large parts of a system, there is no distinction between orbital and surface berthing.

In peacetime, the main function of a depot is the design and testing of ships. A large staff of naval architects (the cream of the area) and construction personnel is maintained at every depot.

Nobility

The foundation of interstellar government within the Imperium. The Imperium depends on nobles ranging From knights to archdukes to carry the chain of authority and the mantle of responsibility from the Emperor to the people.

Nth Interstellar War

Any one of an indeterminate number of inter stellar wars fought between the Terran Confederation and the First Imperium during the Period -2408 and -2219. The First Interstellar War (-2408 to -2400) marked the initial clash between Terra and Vland. The peace that concluded the hostilities was both uneasy and short. The second through seventh wars were marked by seesaw exchanges of territory, mostly confined to the Dingir and Sol subsectors. These initial wars were fought, on the Vilani side, with only the forces available to the Vilani provincial governor; central government was preoccupied with other problems. This was fortunate for the Terrans, as Vilani power, even at this late date, was sufficient to crush the Terrans in short order had it been applied.

The Eighth War finally broke open the frontier and ended in the first major Terran victory. Finally, the Grand Imperium took notice, and dispatched major fleet elements to the area, but the time for action had passed. Terran invention of the jump-3 drive made the Ninth War a crushing victory for Terra and forced the Vilani to relinquish most of the Solomani Rim. Thereafter, the Terrans were almost constantly on the offensive.

In the centuries after the conclusion of the wars, no consensus could be reached in the academic community as to when the later conflicts began or ended; all were interrupted several times by armistices, cease fires, or shaky periods of peace (indeed, a new war would often break out along the front lines before the existence of a peace treaty could be communicated to the respective capitals).

Periods of warfare are lumped together or split apart depending on the historian's individual point of view, and a single war to one historian can be identified as two or more wars by others. The situation is complicated by the fact that for some of the years in question are sketchy. To clarify matters, an accommodation was arrived at which simply labels all interstellar wars after the Ninth with the indeterminate N. Proper usage calls for the war to be defined with the actual years being discussed. Many history texts use this system to refer to all the wars except the first.

The Nth Interstellar War (-2235 to -2219) ended the series when the Vilani Grand Imperium collapsed, as much from its own weight, age, and decadence as from Terran victories. The terrans moved quickly to occupy the remaining Vilani territory.

Octagon Society

Established in 342, the Octagon Society was the first major distressed spacefarer assistance operation to appear in the Spinward Marches. The group thrived on public contributions and on some tax revenues for 150 years; then it collapsed in the late 400s when scandals emerged over the quality of shelter construction and the disposition of certain funds.

Society shelters were generally of an octagonal shape. Large hostels were established on major worlds, while smaller weather shelters were placed on frontier or unsettled worlds. The characteristic octagon-shaped buildings are still visible on various worlds, although none are still in use as shelters for distressed spacefarers.

The Octagon Society was dissolved in 499, and its assets were sold at auction.

Olympiad

Common translation of tleqazdijdiet, a Zhodani measure of time representing three Zhodani years (each approximately .75 standard years). An olympiad is used to denote the period from one set of psionic games to the next. The olympiad is used in the Zhodani calendar to mark dates, which are further subdivided by year, season and day.

Oort Cloud

A spherical shell around most stars containing numerous small bodies of cometary material. A typical Oort cloud is about 0.5 to 1 light year from its primary and has an aggregate mass about that of Terra; density is thus extremely low. The main constituents of cometary bodies are ice and dust ("dirty snowballs"). Bodies in the Oort cloud are occasionally perturbed by collisions or by the influence of nearby stars into orbits which pass near the star; these form comets. The Oort clouds are named after the discoverer of Sol's, Terran astronomer Jan Oort.

Orbital Terraforming

A process by which the immensely difficult and often dangerous task of transforming possible colony planets into more habitable worlds through forestation, detoxification and oxygenation of the atmosphere and hydrosphere, recomposition of the climate, etc. could all be conducted from the safety of an orbiting spacecraft through use of drones without the delay, expense or error of planet-bound human teams.

Outrim Void

Colloquial name for the region to the rimward of the Marches consisting of many small empires and independent worlds. the region is largely unknown to the civilian population of the Imperium, and is regarded with suspicion by the average citizen due to its being a natural haunt for corsairs and any who wish to escape Imperial justice. Many Outrim worlds are believed to have been settled in the great Terran age of expansion known as the Rule of Man, and since isolated from other human contact, whilst others have retained links with either the Imperium or the Zhodani Consulate.

Many Outrim worlds are believed to have been settled in the great Terran age of expansion known as the Ramshackle Empire, and have since been isolated from other human contact. Often these worlds have reverted to low-tech societies. However, some worlds have retained links with either the Imperium or the Zhodani Consulate as client states.

The region forms part of the Trojan Reach sector.

Outworld Coalition

Traditional name for the belligerent groups allied against the Imperium during the First and Second Frontier Wars. Commonly applied to any alliance of powers threatening the Spinward Marches and Imperial territories spinward of the Great Rift.

The original Outworld Coalition was formed in the early 500s at the instigation of the Zhodani Consulate. Vargr allegiances vacillated, but memories of the Imperial campaigns against certain Vargr states in the Corridor swayed some into membership. Zhodani as the major partner, contributed military aid and assistance (such as technicians). While some Vargr governments contributed personnel and naval units, other Vargr remained neutral or sided with the Imperium. The initial history of the coalition was one of continuing struggle for organization, as the Zhodani were continually occupied in establishing Vargr governments, and then maintaining them in power. The intent was for Vargr to raid the coreward edge of the Spinward Marches, especially Regina and Aramis subsectors, while the major thrust from Zhodani took Cronor and Jewell subsectors. The Vargr portions of the offensive failed dismally. Furthermore, the failure resulted in the collapse of the coalition.

The internal Imperial upheavals (the Civil War) which followed the First Frontier War (it was called just the Frontier War then) exposed a continuing weakness in the Imperium, and the Outworld Coalition reformed after a hiatus of five years. At the appropriate moment, the reformed Coalition again attacked the Marches, this time taking portions of Jewell subsector. Although the Vargr again failed to take any territory permanently, their performance as a whole was considerably improved.

Traditionally, frontier wars in the Spinward Marches have involved coalitions of Zhodani and certain Vargr states. the Sword Worlds have also joined the coalition at times.

Oynprith

Language used between Droyne involved in interstellar commerce. Its origins are not well understood, but it appears to have survived as a formal language for quasireligious ceremonies. The language is assumed to have been the most common in whatever previous community the Droyne dominated.

Pacification Campaigns
(76-120)

A series of economic, diplomatic and military operations directed at forcing membership in the Imperium upon those worlds which resisted the initial efforts to annex them.

Although the campaigns were predominantly economic and diplomatic in nature, the Imperium was not averse to using force when peaceful methods failed. Imperial battlefleets and ground forces rarely failed when brought to bear.

By 120, the pacification campaigns had ended, and the initial phase of the Imperium's growth came close.

Four specific Pacification Campaigns were undertaken, each by an archduke of the Imperium. The Vilani Pacification Campaign was targeted at portions of Dagudashaag and Gushemege sectors. The Ilelish Pacification Campaign was aimed at the Darmine region. The Antarean Pacification Campaign hit much of Lishun sector. The Sylean Pacification Campaign operated in Delphi and Fornast sectors.

Pan Galactic Friends of Life

an influential pressure group, concerned with preventing damage to environments by intelligent life. Once considered a member of the lunatic fringe, they gained credibility with their successful defense of the declining herds of dawnsingers. Their most recent major victory was in forcing Seaharvester to accept low quotas for the slaughter of daghadasi.

^^^^

PDPT-beta

Chemical compound discovered by Seaharvester (now a subsidiary of SuSAG, LIC) scientists in the corpse of a prereproductive phase daghadasi (large water animal) some eight years ago. The full name of the compound, Cis-1,2 paradichlorotirethylaminoprocycloheptatrenyl-4-tricyclohexenebeta, is rarely used.

The chemical serves as the basis for a family of experimental broad-spectrum antibiotics which can be selectively "tuned" to wipe out specific types of bacterial, viral, and cancerous growths, while leaving adjacent benign growths untouched. Thus far, no synthesis of the chemical has been produced, and the ecology of the daghadasi homeworld was in danger of serious danger of becoming unbalanced, until the actions of the Pan Galactic Friends of Life persuaded SuSAG to take action.

Phoenix Project

Reported plot by Solomani guerrillas on Terra to destroy Imperial forces occupying Terra. Imperial intelligence reported penetration of the project command in 1045, with subsequent compromise of its basic plans and dismantling of its structure. The Phoenix Project has supposedly born in the final years of the Solomani Rim War (990 to 1002) as Solomani leaders saw the possibility of their defeat and the loss of the homeworld to the invading Imperials. The project was said to have consisted of two distinct parts: prepositioned caches of Military goods to supply the coming uprising and a continuing program for the training of guerrillas.

The caches were concealed in many different places on Terra in areas calculated to preclude accidental discovery over the years. Each cache contained large quantities of munitions, weapons, vehicles, and medical supplies, all of varying technological levels so as to be of use regardless of the technical knowledge of the users. Each cache was hidden with its location entrusted to a single local family. These families were to form the core of the guerrilla forces when the rising was to take place.

A massive Imperial counter-guerrilla effort in 1040 to 1045 was directed at the discovery and destruction of the caches and the arrest of the families entrusted with the secrets.

Persistent rumors of two additional aspects of the Project-Lambda (a code word to trigger the uprising) and Omega (the reinforcement of the uprising by offworld Solomani) have been dismissed as baseless by Imperial officials.

Many historians believe that the extent of the plot was greatly exaggerated by Imperial authorities, and hold that it was little more than an extreme example of wishful thinking on the part of the Solomani leadership. At any rate, the Phoenix project no longer threatens the security of the Imperium, if indeed it ever did.

Postal Union

A group of political units associated to a greater or lesser degree for the purpose of communication among citizens, businesses, and governmental units.

Nearly all star systems are members of one postal union or another. Governments cooperate along their borders in order to allow the efficient flow of communications between them. Members of a postal union forward mail through their territories (subject, of course, to local security needs, acts of War, and so on) to the proper addresses. On the average, communication is at the speed of the fastest available transportation. Within the Imperium, such unions often pay a voluntary tax to the IISS Communication Office in order to use their facilities for communications. Private companies have also been known to provide such services.

^^^^

Psionics

The criminal use of mental powers for the manipulation of matter and energy and for communication. It has been demonstrated that minds (human or non-human, conscious or unconscious, intelligent or unintelligent) contain some capacity to operate without apparent use of physical facilities. For an individual to seek training in such abilities is a criminal act.

Until circa -1000, psionics was little studied in most regions except on a disorganized level (parapsychology, the occult, spiritualism, and so on). It was known and practiced among the Zhodani and by some minor races, but it was by no means wide spread.

However, during the Long Night, many races, (human and others) turned introspective. As a result, many finally began to engage in serious research in psionics, which revealed much about the empirical nature of the phenomenon, although the principles involved were, and remain, little understood.

Even though it assumed scientific validity, psionics remained a backwater science until about 650, when it underwent a tremendous burst of popularity. Psionics within the Imperium reached its peak in the latter half of the 700s. In the 790s, however, the crest of popular opinion broke with the revelation of scandals within the Psionics Institutes; the result was the psionics suppressions (800 to 826), which shifted public opinion away from support of psionics.

^^^^

Psionics Institute

Any clandestine organization devoted to illegal training of individuals in the use of psionics talents. Active Imperial campaigns to eradicate the Institute have been pursued for over 200 years.

Organizations of this nature have existed since before the advent of space travel, but they attained prominence only during the Long Night, when reproducible scientific discoveries made psionics a teachable, learnable science.

In the Imperial ante-bellum period, psionics institutes were rare, and they were formed only on a few scattered worlds, which for one reason or another, had an unusually high rate of psionics talents appearing, or which encouraged psionics for social, political or commercial reasons. In the years after the Civil War, institutes were organized on most high population worlds within the Imperium. Psionics institute is a generic
name; each such institution was independently organized and maintained. Institutes were generally supported by that portion of the population which had psionic talents; since that portion has small, they were viable only on high population worlds.

During the psionics suppressions, the institutes' charters were revoked, and talented individuals were persecuted. In some cases, the individuals fled to assume new identities on other worlds; in others, whole families emigrated to the Zhodani Consulate or to other places beyond the frontiers of the Imperium.

Following the psionics suppressions, there were theoretically no psionics institutes remaining. In practice, however, illegal underground institutes are rumored to still remain on many worlds.

^^^^

Psionics Suppressions
(800 to 826)

Between 772 and 798, a series of financial, ethical, and moral scandals within the Psionics Institutes of the Imperium shifted public opinion against the institutes. At the same time, it became clear that a good number of the institutes were under the control of the Zhodani Consulate. In 800, the Imperium moved against the institutes by canceling their charters, jailing their leaders, and passing laws restricting the teaching or practice of psionics. Many institute figures went underground to espouse their cause in a type of guerrilla war.

The Psionic Suppressions had a profound influence on Imperial opinion. Over the course of 26 years, the Suppressions equated psionics with the Zhodani and established in the average Imperial citizen a distaste for both which continues to this day. The average citizen will admit to a general dislike of psionics, and if pressed, will usually state that psionics violates a persons right of mental privacy.

Psychohistory

The science of historical prediction and macrosocial manipulation . The main thesis of psychohistory is that the action of trillions of individuals take on a fluidity and predictability which can be compared to that of molecules in a gas. The very size of the population being dealt with factors out individual peculiarities and allows the prediction of its behavior. With the ability to predict the reaction of a population to a particular stimulus comes the ability to manipulate that population, Psychohistorians reason psychohistory began as a combination of public relations/advertising techniques and behavioral science, and although its techniques have been put on a more rigorous footing, the basic principles are still not well understood. A number of minor experiments have confirmed the general validity of the science, but it was also shown to be too expensive to be of practical utility. Research continues at a small number of Imperial universities.

^^^^

Pyramid

Traditional construction form for developing cultures; considered to be the simplest form of large scale architecture because of its load-bearing strengthand ease of assembly. TL 1.

Pyramid structures of all sizes have been believed to serve as focuses for psionic (or cosmic) power, and are claimed to sharpen dulled edges, cure diseases, and generally work miracles.

Pyramids have been constructed on most worlds where the local culture haspassed through TL 1. Many examples remain due to the massive strength of the structure .

Rachele Society

Secret Vilani supremacist group founded on Pretoria (Deneb/Pretoria 0405) by Zid Rachele in 992. Genocidal policies favoured by the group culminated in the attempted takeover of the Pretorian government in 1010. An attempt
at nuclear blackmail backfired when 26,000 people (including 1900 Rachelean commandos) were killed by a nuclear explosion after the Society seized Imperial Scout facilities on Saki (Deneb/Pretoria 0504). Zid Rachele disappeared in 1015 after escaping from the prison world Exile (Deneb/Usani 1928).

In 1103, Zid Rachele and the Rachele Society surfaced again in Lishun in a brief power play at Dynam Naval Depot (Lishun/ Masionia 1219). Rachele and his followers attempted the theft of several mothballed naval warships but were quickly defeated. Zid Rachele's vessel was destroyed in the battle.

Rachelean Revolts
(1010-1011)

Major uprising on Pretoria (Deneb/Pretoria 0405) fomented by the Rachele Society, which resulted in martial law under the Imperial Navy since that time. The Imperium as a rule does not interfere with local politics, but their intervention was forced when a Scout base on Saki (Deneb/Pretoria 0504) was destroyed by nuclear weapons.

Ramshackle Empire

Common term used during the Long Night to refer to the Rule of Man, also known as the Second Imperium. As the successor to the First Imperium, the Rule of Man took over the territories (and the problems) of its predecessor. Pro-Second Imperium histories contend that the Rule of Man delayed the inevitable collapse. Pro-First Imperium histories claim that the First Imperium was stagnant, but stable, and that the Ramshackle Empire actually precipitated the Long Night by looting subject worlds and promoting Terran superiority.

See also Rule of Man.

^^^^

Red Zone

The Traveller's Aid Society travel zone classification for a nation, world or system which is dangerous to travellers. In general, the imposition of a red zone classification indicates the location is quarantined, interdicted by higher authority, or at war.

Quarantine indicates that a dangerous disease is present and the danger of war is self explanatory, but interdiction requires further discussion. Interstellar governments often find it necessary to restrict access to worlds or systems for political or military reasons, and they do so by publishing interdictions.

Enforcement of interdiction varies with the reason for the restriction. Interdiction may be imposed on a world if it is a military base or other sensitive installation, for private reservations belonging to powerful families desiring seclusion, for developing societies which government has elected to allow to evolve in isolation, or for valuable resource areas being saved for later development or exploitation.

^^^^

Repatriation Bond

A document guaranteeing passage of an individual to a specified location upon completion of contract work or upon suspension of contract work for any reason. Repatriation bonds are guarantees given as inducements to workers who might otherwise be wary of leaving their own worlds with no assurance that they could return. They are most commonly used by mercenary units. Repatriation bonds are usually administered by a large financial institution which holds the necessary funds in escrow.

Rule of Man
(-2204 to -1776)

(Also called the Second Imperium and, disparagingly, the Ramshackle Empire.) A short-lived interstellar empire formed after the conquest of the Vilani Imperium by the Terrans. The conquered territories were under military rule from -2219 to -2204. Vilani military forces were incorporated into the Terran forces. Terran naval officers took over key posts in the Vilani bureaucracy (which otherwise remained intact).

In -2204, the Terran Secretariat attempted to transfer control directly to Terra and to incorporate the conquered regions into the Terran Confederation. The commander in chief of the Terran Navy, Admiral Hiroshi Estigarribia, realised that the Confederation government could not possibly control the vast territories of the Vilani Imperium. He proclaimed himself Regent of the Vilani Imperium, and protector of Terra, so both states were now united in the Rule of Man. Nearly all the fleet sided with Estigarribia both because it was composed largely of colonials, who were under|represented in the Terran Confederation government, and because of Estigarribia's careful preparation. The Confederation was dissolved without significant resistance.

The Terran fleet headquarters on Dingir became the capital of the Rule of Man. The bureaucratic centre of the Imperium remained on Vland, although arrangements were undertaken to gradually transfer it elsewhere.

Upon Estigarribia's death, he was succeeded by his chief of staff, who crowned himself Emperor Hiroshi II. Estigarribia, even though he did not actually assume the crown, is therefore known to history as Emperor Hiroshi I.

Hiroshi II transferred all functions of government from both Vland and Dingir to a more centrally located world renamed bilingually Hub (Massilia/Ershur 0402). This world was to remain capital of the Rule of Man for the next four hundred years.

During the Rule of Man, large numbers of humans from Terra and its oldest colonies emigrated throughout the Imperium. People of Terran ancestry or culture (many of them assimilated Vilani) assumed positions of power on most worlds and became industrialists and administrators.

The problems of sheer size and scientific stagnation, which had brought about the fall of the Vilani Imperium, continued to plague the Rule of Man. The Vilani had coped with the problems of ruling a large empire by a rigid caste system with all citizens rooted permanently in their places, but this system could only last as long as there was no significant external threats. The Terrans did away with the system but were not able to replace it with a new social order. The destruction of the caste system swept away the foundations of society. Key industries fell apart as their workers became free to move elsewhere.

The -1776 date for the end of the Rule of Man is arbitrary and it notes the financial collapse of the central government which occurred when the Treasury at Hub/Ershur refused to honour a monetary issue of the branch treasury at Antares. The resulting lack of confidence within monetary circles marked the end of large-scale interstellar trade and of effective governmental power within the Rule of Man. Although the Imperium did not completely fall apart for many years, the Rule of Man had effectively ceased to exist as a viable interstellar community, and the period known as Twilight had begun.

The Third Imperium refers to the Rule of Man as the Second Imperium, which emphasises its own roots in the Solomani dominated Second Imperium and the Vilani dominated First Imperium. Anti| Solomani elements emphasise the failure of the Solomani dominated Ramshackle Empire.

^^^^

Rule of Terra

Solomani terrorist group active in selected regions of the Solomani/Imperial border. Violently anti Imperial even by the standards of most Solomani political groups, the Rule of Terra seeks to force the return of all "rightful Terran property" to Solomani hands through assassination and other acts of violence.

The organisation, although interstellar in scope, was apparently not a very strong organisation in the beginning; some of its claimed attacks have proven to be accidents, while others were the work of different dissident individuals or organisations.

The Rule of Terra's acts, although not its goals, have been disavowed by many other Solomani groups, including the Confederation government; in return, the Rule of Terra has attacked even Solomani populations, stating that "all who do not contribute to the Manifest Destiny of the Race are not worthy to be part of the Race".

Since the death of Strephon and the resulting Solomani incursions into the rimward reaches of the Imperium, the Rule of Terra organisation has apparently mushroomed in popularity. The group has claimed responsibility for many terrorist acts along the current Solomani/Imperium border.

Rydel Expeditions

In 153 and again in 160, expeditions lead by Admiral Inesh Rydel tried to locate a useable jump route across the Great Rift from Corridor (rimward) to, Deneb. The first expedition originated from Sinta (Corridor 2037) and eventually arrived by various routes at Ashishinipar (Corridor 0931). Nearly a year was spent trying to find a way to go further to no avail. A second attempt, made by a different route ended on Ishirdu (Corridor 0338). This proved closer, but not close enough to Yoma (Deneb/Vast Heavens 3031), the closest possible world in this area of the rift.

More successful rift-crossing expeditions have been undertaken in recent years, most notably those of Kirshamii Riilam.

SuSAG
Schunamann und Sohn AG
LIC (SuSAG,LIC)

SuSAG is involved in a wide range of chemical, pharmaceutical, and genetic engineering activities. SuSAG is the primary manufacturer of anagathics for the Imperium, and maintains psi drug manufacturing plants in client states outside Imperial borders. Because of the bad reputation for safety of its chemical/biological warfare division, the firm is not well liked in many regions, even though all of SuSAG's dangerous manufacturing plants and experimental stations are located on remote, uninhabited planetoids. Since sabotage of its plants is wide spread, and its products extremely valuable, the firm maintains a large paramilitary security force equipped at tech level 12-14 standards.

SuSAG was founded in 252 by Gustav Schunamann, financed from royalties received for his purification process for various psionic drugs, and using the shell of a bankrupt Sylean firm (hence the archaic AG in its name). In 800, psi drugs were declared illegal, all plants engaged in their manufacture within the Imperium closed, and all stocks confiscated and destroyed. Fortunately for SuSAG, the firm had by then expanded into other operations, and although badly damaged, managed to survive and prosper.

In the Spinward Marches, SuSAG has facilities on many industrial worlds. The company supplies a large proportion of the sectors chemical and biological weapons, and owns several isolated laboratories in the Glisten (Spinward Marches/Glisten 2036) belt.

Stock Ownership: Schunamann family- 52%, Imperial family- 2%, Hortalez et Cie- 9%, Other corporations- 24%, Private ownership- 7%, Other- 6%.

Scout Base

Port facility for the support, maintenance, and repair of scout vessels. The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service maintains a variety of scout bases scattered throughout the Imperium, with installations tending to be on less well developed worlds with starports type D or C. Scout bases tend to be surface installations equipped with basic facilities for fuelling and for minor maintenance activities oriented toward ships of displacement 1000 or less.

Scout bases are positioned in systems more out of the way than are naval bases for a reason. The scout bases serve as a source of ships carrying dispatches from the well-travelled xboat lanes to more remote worlds.

Scout bases also have other responsibilities, and most have an administrative responsibility in addition to the maintenance and refuelling of scout ships. Within a subsector, one base will hold responsibility for cartography in the subsector, another will be responsible for technical developments, and still another for contact and liaison activities. The scout base is more extensive than an xboat station, but less comprehensive than a way station.

Second Frontier War
(615-620)

Fought between the Outworld Coalition and the Imperium during the period of the Barracks Emperors. Arbellatra (b. 587, d. 666) was named Grand-Admiral of the Marches and led the combined local and Imperial forces to defeat the Coalition, and thenproceeded to restablish the central Imperial authority. She was named Regent in 622 as a result, and Empress in 629.

Sector

Mapping unit in astrography encompassing sixteen subsectors. Average density of 500 to 650 worlds per sector.

Sectors are named, and several synonyms are in common use, including march (or marches), region, reach (or reaches), quadrant, and matrix. The Spinward Marches, for example is a sector.

As a rough means of comparing size, the sector counts of the large interstellar states and areas of settlement are as follows: the Imperium:27; the Aslan Hierate:18; the Hive Federation:17; the Vargr Extents:14; the Two Thousand Worlds:14; the Zhodani Consulate:13; the Solomani Confederation:11.

Seneschal

An aide or executive officer. For high-ranking officials, the wide range of responsibilities of high office are manageable only through computer assistance. Even then, the information flow may be too great. The seneschal is a product of the computer age - an adjutant or assistant with responsibilities in information management. The seneschal has no authority of his own; he manages the massive input of information associated with his superior's position, keeping the official informed, but not overwhelmed.

On Old Earth (or in low-tech feudal societies), the seneschal was the person in charge of a noble's estate. In more modern times, the role has changed to that of aide or executive officer.

Sharurshid

A Vilani trade and speculation corporation, with very little manufacturing capability. Sharurshid trades in luxury goods from all parts of the Imperium and many areas beyond. Most rare Terran wines and spirits are carried on the starships of Sharurshid. Sharurshid is one of the least active megacorporations in the Spinward Marches, although it does own several unique areas and planets with a view to developing products as sought after luxuries. Few Marcher markets are rich enough to afford Sharurshid's prices.

Trades in all luxury goods from all parts of the Imperium and many areas beyond. It began as a merchant company; its success as a carrier of luxury goods allowed it to expand into other areas, although it still has very little manufacturing capability. Its major source of income has always been its fleets of starships travelling between the many worlds of the Imperium.

Sharurshid traces its lineage back to the First Imperium. During the Interstellar Wars, Sharurshid was the major bureau in the First Imperium's rimward sectors.

Interests: Trade and speculation, luxury goods. Most rare Terran wines and spirits travel on the starships of Sharurshid.

Home Port: Vland ( Vland / Vland 1717).

Shudusham Concords

The Shudusham Concords were a direct response to a tragic attack against the Sylean Federation in -112. In that year, a terrorist group rigged a Dover-Gabe courier robot to self-destruct, and managed to smuggle it aboard a 90,000 ton Sylean battleship. The vessel, Empire's Banner, was on a goodwill mission in orbit around the world Fornol ( Core / Core 1715) when the robot 's hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell exploded. Fornol 's premier, two ambassadors, and the Sylean vice-minister were killed, along with a host of ship's officers and crewmen. The repercussions from this event were so far reaching that the Sylean Federation was nearly thrown into civil war.

The disaster prompted twelve worlds of the Sylean Federation to meet on the neutral world of Shudusham ( Core / Core 2214) to draft an agreement dealing with the weaponry carried by robots . After much deliberation, all twelve worlds finally signed the completed Shudusham Concords in -110. A hardcopy is on display in the Museum of Sylean History on Capital ( Core / Core 2118).

The Concords have no legal force in the Third Imperium, but many worlds have adopted similar or identical standards using the Concords as a template, and most robots produced commercially in the Imperium are designed with these restrictions in mind.

The Concords contain seven articles: 
Article 1
Gives a general explanation of the document, overall guidelines for robot construction, locations and occasions for robot use, and the rights of robot owners. The robot 's owner is responsible for all actions the robot may perform, whether direct or indirect. Reliability is thus identified as a key issue, as is motivation for a robot equipped with a weapon or used as a weapon. 

Article 2
Describes detailed programming guidelines for general functions.

Article 3
Covers detailed manufacturing standards to ensure reliability, and provide for the safety of owners and the general public.

Article 4
Gives guidelines for when and where weapons are allowed or prohibited

Article 5
Describes specific programming logic for weapon control and usage. Most strongly worded of all the articles.

Article 6
Describes detailed manufacturing standards to ensure weapon reliability, when weapon installation is allowed.

Article 7
Provides for a new agency whose sole responsibility is to enforce the articles of the Concords. 

Forty-three amendments were added over the active life of the Concords, dealing with technological changes, minor logic enhancements, and additional enforcement procedures. The 37th amendment is well-known; it states that no pseudo-biological robot may attempt to pass itself off as a living being.

The Shudusham Concords proved to be effective. An entire interstellar industry grew out of the need for sensory devices to aid in enforcement of the Concords on the original twelve member worlds and later signatories. The Concords lost their legal force when Cleon I declared himself Emperor of the Third Imperium in Year 0.

Most worlds still use parts of the pre-Imperial Shudusham Concords as a model for their own laws to keep abuses with robots in check. Most worlds declare an owner to be responsible for the actions of his robot , even if the owner did not directly order the action. For example, if an owner orders his robot to protect his home, and in doing so the robot accidentally kills someone approaching the home, the owner can be charged with accidental murder.

Signal GK

Abbreviation for Gashimeku Kaalariin, Vilani for "vessel in distress". The code signal GK originated on Vland as a distress signal in maritime and aviation activity, and it was one of the standard communication codes of the Vilani Imperium. When the Second Imperium succeeded it, signal GK was retained as a distress code co-equal with the Terran SOS and Mayday signals.

The Imperial Navigation Act of 103 requires all vessels, whether military or civilian, to respond to the GK, SOS, or Mayday signals provided such a response does not endanger the fabric or crew of the responding vessel.

See also Mayday, SOS.

Six Races

Traditional term for the intelligent races which dominate this region of the galaxy. It appears independently in Aslan, Vargr, and K'kree literature.

There is some disagreement as to the meaning of the term and the identity of the races involved. Most commentators agree that all of the six races must be major races; the candidates are Aslan, Droyne, Hive, K'kree, Solomani, Vargr, Vilani, and Zhodani. Various racially based hypothesis have emerged, but none have gained ascendancy.

Soegz

Admiral Soegz was a loyal supporter of Arbellatra in the final years of the Civil War, and he was elevated to Archduke of Antares by her decree, which incidentally and simultaneously ordered the execution of the previous archduke for treason.

Soegz, a Vargr and a subordinate admiral under Arbellatra, commanded a task force during the fleet actions of the Second Frontier War and late in the Civil War.

^^^^

Solomani

Strictly, a member of that human race which developed on Terra from the original human stock (H. Sapiens). The term Solomani is often used to refer to members of the Solomani race (or, more palatably to some, to members of the human race of Solomani descent) or to members of the Solomani political movement. Its original meaning is obscure, but the word seems to have derived from either "men of Sol" or "sole men".

After the Solomani developed jump drives in -2431, Solomani humans scattered to the stars in several waves. Early colonisation efforts first settled the worlds closest to Terra; the later conquest of the First Imperium and the establishment of the Rule of Man sent more Solomani humans out primarily to occupy former Vilani controlled regions.

^^^^

Solomani Autonomous Region

Area within the Imperium granted self-government through a charter from Empress Margaret I in 704.

The charter granted control of the region of space within a radius of 50 parsecs of Terra (hence the name Solomani Sphere) to a Solomani governing body, which was given broad powers of authority.

For two hundred years, the Imperium effectively ignored the region and concentrated instead on its coreward frontiers.

By 940, Solomani oppression of non-human (and non-Solomani) worlds forced Empress Margaret II to revoke the region's charter. After years of diplomatic actions proved fruitless, it was decided to forcibly reintegrate the region into the Imperium. Naturally, the Solomani resisted, and the Solomani Rim War (990 to 1002) began.

^^^^

Solomani Confederation

In 871, the government of the Solomani Autonomous Region reorganised itself as the Solomani Confederation in an attempt to strengthen its claims to the heritage of the old Terran Confederation. Although tantamount to a declaration of independence, the reorganisation was officially ignored by the government of the Imperium until the increasingly belligerent and extremist policies of the Solomani caused many border worlds under Solomani rule to petition the Imperium for redress.

The branches of the Solomani Confederation's government took the names of the government of the Terran Confederation, but the present institutions have little resemblance to those of the past. The chief governing body is the Secretariat. This is presided over by the Secretary General, who is elected from its membership. The Secretary General is the chief administrative officer of the Solomani government, and while the office holds great power, it is fully accountable to the Secretariat.

Representatives to the Secretariat are appointed by the governments of the individual districts. The number of representatives each district may appoint is determined according to that district's contribution to the Solomani economy. A district typically consists of a single world, but low population worlds or depressed areas are combined into multi world districts. In the case of a district such as this, an election is held to determine the representative from that district. These, however, are not elections in the normal sense: the governments vote rather than the populace. Each government of such a district is allocated votes (again, according to its economic importance), which are used to elect a representative for that district.

All government office holders and officials must be members of the official party, the Solomani Movement. Although formerly of great power and influence, the party is now weak, decentralised and of little importance. Real power in the Confederation is held by the government and the factions.

Because of the greater degree of local autonomy that exists in the Solomani Confederation, inter world factionalism exists to a much greater degree than would be allowed in the Imperium. Coalitions of worlds exist outside the normal government channels, sometimes equalling them in importance within a given region. For example, the Near Bootes cluster, in the Solomani Rim, dominates large portions of the adjacent subsectors, both economically and politically. Bootean mercantile interests heavily favour peaceful trade with the Imperium, and their influence with the Confederation government is considered to be the primary reason for the unofficial detente between the Confederation and the Imperium. Another example of this factionalism is the ongoing trade war between Kukulcan (Kukulcan 0405) and the coalition of Thetis (Kukulcan 0108) and Laputa (Kukulcan 0310). The war is causing severe damage to the economy of Kukulcan, but the Thetis-Laputa coalition has thus far been able to muster enough power to prevent effective intervention by the Confederation government.

Solomani Hypothesis

When the Solomani discovered jump drive in -2431, they also discovered that more than a dozen human races had already colonised the worlds surrounding Terra. At the same time, there was no satisfactory explanation for the more than 40 genetically identical human races.

The Solomani Hypothesis, first proposed by Magis Sergei haut-Devroe (64 to 141), theorised that all of the many widely scattered human races of the galaxy originated on Terra, and he thought that they were transported to their current homeworlds by an alien race (called the Ancients) for purposes which even today remain unclear. The approximate date of the scattering has been established as -300,000.

When Terra was incorporated into the Imperium in 588, a small historical mission verified much of haut-Devroe's work. The hypothesis was already generally accepted by the majority of the human population in the Imperium.

More than 40 known human races have been located (and several more of them failed to adapt to their new worlds and are now extinct); only three of these human races have reached widespread prominence: they are the Vilani, the Zhodani, and the Solomani. Most other human races accept the hypothesis but lend it no special importance. The hypothesis is used by the Solomani Movement as a basis for its claims of Solomani racial superiority.

Solomani Rim War
(990 to 1002)

War between the Third Imperium and the Solomani Confederation during which a large portion of the Solomani Rim sector was returned to Imperial control. Hoping to profit from Imperial preoccupation with the Third Frontier War and the disorganisation which followed upon the abdication of Styryx in 989, the Solomani reasserted their control over the complete Solomani Sphere, including those portions reabsorbed into the Imperium (see Solomani Autonomous Region). The Imperium declared war in 990.

The initial phase of the war went very well for the Solomani. Although the Imperium maintained sizeable fleets along the border, they were inferior in strength to the massed naval elements of the Solomani Confederation. In most areas, the Solomani regained the border worlds lost to the Imperium in the last half century and even occupied a number of worlds that had never been part of the Solomani Sphere.

However, Solomani fortunes were checked in 993 when a large invasion force attempted to regain the worlds in the Old Expanses sector; it encountered near- fanatical resistance and was repulsed with heavy losses.

The period from 993 to 998 was one of stalemate. The Solomani abandoned their plans for further expansion in order to rebuild their forces. However, their policy of inflexibly defending every border world was a constant drain on their resources, and the Solomani were not able to regain the initiative. By 998, the Imperial Navy had achieved strategic dominance as the greater industrial base of the Imperium made its power felt.

The last phase of the war, 998 to 1002, consisted of a near continual advance by Imperial forces into the heart of the Solomani Sphere. The basic Imperial strategy was to attack along two parallel axes of advance, with lesser task forces spreading out to create a huge pocket of Solomani territory.

Although the Solomani occasionally achieved a tactical success against a task force (such as in the Battle of Kagukhasaggan in early 1002), they were unable to halt the main advances. With the liberation of the Vegan district in 1001, the Imperium gained the secure base envisioned in the reign of Styryx. The loss of the Vegan district prompted the Solomani to embark on a desperate gamble. Recalling the time when the out numbered Terran Confederation was able to defeat the Vilani Imperium, the Solomani consolidated their remaining naval forces into a single fleet and struck at the Imperial fleet that was advancing out of the Vegan district. At the Battle of Dingir, in early 1002, the Solomani Grand Fleet was scattered and substantially destroyed. The remnants of the Solomani fleet fell back deeper into the Sphere and the Imperial forces firmly established themselves in Terra's own subsector.

The Imperial high command decided that Terra would have to be invaded in order to end forever all claims of Solomani superiority and thus the use of Terra as a rallying standard elsewhere in the Sphere. In order to invade Terra, a sizeable fraction of the Imperial forces in the Solomani Sphere were assembled into an assault force, which effectively ended the pursuit of the defeated Solomani fleet. The invasion began in the second quarter of 1002, and the hard fought campaign lasted until nearly the end of the year. In the end, the Imperium conquered the planet. However, the battle for Terra had consumed so much of the Imperial military's resources that the Imperial high command felt they lacked sufficient strength to resume their advance into the rest of the Solomani Sphere. Accordingly, they negotiated a temporary armistice with the Solomani military commanders, who were glad to gain a respite to regroup their remaining forces. The war ended on this basis as both the Imperial and Solomani civilian governments, who were concerned with the strain placed on their economies by the protracted war, informally agreed to extend the armistice indefinitely.

Although scholars have debated the wisdom of invading Terra, some claim that the battle was a marginal if not a pyrrhic victory for the Imperium. The general consensus has been that the war as a whole was a victory for the Imperium. A substantial amount of the Solomani Sphere was reabsorbed by the Imperium, and a vigorous Vegan Autonomous District was set up to oversee Imperial interests along the new border.

Solomani Security

Secret police force maintained in service to the Solomani Confederation for the purpose of maintaining state secrets, conducting espionage, and implementing political policies of the government.

Solomani Security maintains both a network of contacts which provide information from outside the Confederation and a network of informants which provide information within the Confederation. Solomani Security agents themselves are highly trained individuals capable of conducting espionage and sabotage.

Spinward Main

A grouping of systems in the Spinward Marches sector, each within jump-1 of another. This grouping forms a corridor that allows jump-1 capable ships to travel to fifteen of the sixteen Spinward Marches subsectors and to 223 of the sector's 437 worlds.

^^^^

Spinward Marches

The Imperium's farthest frontier sector, containing 437 star systems divided along a coreward to rimward line by the Imperial border. The region is dominated by two major powers: the Imperial Spinward Marches sector and the frontier provinces of the Zhodani Consulate. In the independent territory between the two powers lie three small states: the Federation of Arden, the Sword Worlds Confederation, and the Darrian Confederation. Each follows its own diplomatic line designed to maintain independence from both the Zhodani and the Imperium.

The Spinward Marches has been settled since the 400s and is still a frontier sector. High-tech worlds are scattered among empty, fallow worlds; there is potential for exploration, exploitation, and development for centuries to come.

Starport

Established for the landing, servicing, refuelling, and control of starships. Starports range in quality from A (the best and most extensive) to E (the worst, little more than a spot of cleared ground).

Starports generally have two components: a surface facility and an orbital facility. The surface facility includes cargo handling installations, a landing field, control towers, and other necessary areas. Surface starport components are frequently called Dirt-Side, Ground, or Down (as in Credo Down Starport on Regina). Orbital facilities are present (usually in stationary orbit above the surface component) to enable handling of unstreamlined Ships and to allow construction of heavy craft in orbit. The orbital component is often called Shiny-Side, Up, or Orbital (as in Credo Orbital Starport). Type D and E starports have no extensive orbital facilities, but usually have navigational satellites or similar equipment. Unstreamlined ships at these starports must be serviced by shuttles. Starports, being the primary point at Which starships interact with a system, are usually the location for shipyards and additional bases, such as scout bases, naval bases, or other military and governmental installations.

Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi
Emperor of the Imperium
(b. 1049)

Forty-third and current emperor of the Imperium; eldest son of Emperor Paulo III (981 to 1071). Born 1049.

Coronation 1071. Strephon has been criticised for starting to reverse the post Civil War policy of reducing the power of the archdukes. The most controversial such move was the appointment of Dulinor as Archduke Ilelish, who is considered to have an excessively strong power base. The Emperor has also shown considerable interest in the latest technological developments, particularly in the field of pseudo biological robots.

Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi was crowned the 43rd Emperor of the Third Imperium on Capital ( Core / Core 2118) on the fourteenth day of 1071. In the 33 years of his reign, Strephon has distinguished himself as a popular emperor in times of strain within and without the Imperium. Twelfth of the Alkhalikoi Dynasty, Strephon is a young emperor; at 54, he is only four years older than his father, Paulo III, was when crowned. Paulo continued to serve as emperor for 40 years, and died at the age of 90, when Strephon was only 21 years old.

Eleven years later, war broke out on the frontier between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate. Quick reactions on the part of Imperial forces saved the day, and peace was achieved a few years later, in 1084. Emperor Strephon has received much of the credit for the Navy's state of readiness, and its ability to respond to this threat as easily as it did.

Born in 1049, Strephon married his wife Iolanthe in 1067, two days before his eighteenth birthday. Their daughter, Grand Princess Ciencia Iphegenia, is 15 years old.

The Emperor also holds the position of Archduke of Sylea , the original domain.

Sternmetal is primarily engaged in mining operations and manufacturing. It produces mostly power generation equipment of all types including power plants for starships, air and ground vehicles, cities, and industrial installations. Additionally, Sternmetal is the largest manufacturer of food synthesis equipment in the Imperium. In the Spinward Marches, Sternmetal runs a low key operation, and is best known for supplying galley equipment to the sector's smaller ship builders. Various Sternmetal divisions trade under other names, and many individuals are unaware of how often they use Sternmetal's products. The aim of this policy appears simply to reach as many markets as possible with their fundamental trade goods.

Subsector

Mapping unit in astrography.

Artificial mapping unit in astrography, intended to delineate and define locations within the galaxy.

A subsector measures eight parsecs by ten parsecs, and has an average density of 30 to 40 worlds.

Subsectors are noted within a sector by their position using the first 16 letters of the alphabet (A-P). In addition, they are named and may be called by a variety of synonyms, including province, cluster, or district. Imperial convention is to assign numbers to districts which are under Imperial protection, pending their integration into the Imperium. One example is District 268 in the Spinward Marches sector.

In most cases, the subsector is used as a governmental unit within the Imperium. At the fringes of the Imperium, subsectors continue to be defined and carried on maps beyond the Imperial borders.

Superheavy Elements

Although elements heavier than uranium are increasingly unstable and radioactive (with half-lives measured in fractions of a second), quantum theory predicts an "island of stability," consisting of the elements with atomic numbers 114 to 122, which have half-lives measured in the millions of years. These superheavy elements, also called eka-metals or island metals, are generated in small amounts in supernova explosions. Only a few grams have ever been discovered in nature, which is just enough for scientists to determine that superheavies would be immensely valuable to industry if a source could be found.

Survey, First
(published 420)

The first comprehensive astrographic and demographic survey of the Imperium, which was performed by the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service. More than a hundred years in the making, its publication in 420 made available the Imperium's records on its component worlds for public use.

Survey, Second
(published 1065)

The second comprehensive survey of the Imperium, which was performed by the Scout Service, and which updated the long obsolete and incomplete data of the First Survey. The Second Survey was seventy years in compilation, went to greater lengths than the First Survey, and included more world data as well as more complete astrographic data. In addition, the expansion of the Imperium since 420 had added many new worlds to be included.

Sword Worlds Confederation

A loose confederation of worlds in the Spinward Marches, coreward of the Darrians and spinward of Imperial space. The first settlement in the region was on Gram in -399.

By circa -200 the settlement of the area was largely complete, and the first interstellar government in the region, the Sacnoth Dominate, was formed in -186. Consisting of the twenty worlds settled up to that point, the Dominate lasted until 102, when it was fractured by rebellion into several smaller states.

During the ensuing centuries various Sword World governments rose and fell; they sometimes coalesced all the worlds under a single world's domination and sometimes splintered into several small states. Contact with Imperial traders in 73 brought increased trade and had a stabilising influence on the region, but this stability was short-lived.

The First Frontier war brought a desire for cooperation among the various squabbling worlds, and the end of the war saw the formation of the first unified confederation in centuries, centred on Sacnoth, and referred to as the Second Dominate. As a result of the Outworld Coalition's victory, the Sword Worlds annexed Terant 340, Torment, Trifuge, and Cunnonic, which are all in the Darrian subsector.

The Second Dominate held power until 698, when it was overthrown by a coalition headed by Gram. The Gram Coalition ruled until 788, when a short war with the Darrian Confederation resulted in the loss of the four worlds gained during the First Frontier War.

Public outrage at the mishandling of the war caused the subsequent fall of the Gram government. The replacement was the Trilateral Alliance, a decentralised organisation headed by Narsil, Sacnoth, and Durendal. The Alliance broke up in 848 due in large part to the inherent weakness of its organisation, and an interregnum of essentially independent worlds lasted until Gram reasserted its influence (helped substantially by Zhodani money and advisers, rumour has it) in 852. This government has retained control-down to the present day.

The government allows almost complete local autonomy. Individual worlds maintain separate military forces, pass their own laws, and completely regulate their own internal affairs. The Confederation government regulates inter world trade, handles diplomatic relations with outside powers, and adjudicates inter world disputes.

In peacetime, the Confederation government maintains a pool of high ranking military officers (selected from the military forces of all member worlds) who are trained in large unit command and staff operations.

During time of war, all military forces are confederalized and placed under a single unified command. For ground forces, divisions will be commanded by generals from the individual worlds, corps, and higher organisations by Confederation officers. The component forces of a division will be from the same world whenever possible. For naval forces, individual ships are under the command of local officers, squadrons and fleets by Confederation officers.

Sylean Federation
(-650 to 0)

Large interstellar federation which served as the basis for the Third Imperium.

Established on Sylea in -650, the Federation grew slowly, absorbing several surrounding worlds and increasing trade and interaction between worlds.

By -30, the real power in the Federation was an industrial consortium headed by Cleon Zhunastu. Cleon, a Solomani noble of great vision, used his family industrial base and the support of other families (obtained by the persuasiveness of his personality) to obtain behind the scenes control of the Federation government and to begin an active campaign to increase the number of worlds under its control.

After 30 years of economic and diplomatic manoeuvring (and occasional military action), Cleon had increased the size of the Federation and extended its control to the edge of what is now Core sector. Cleon envisioned a territory larger than a single sector, however, and concluded that the tightly controlled, highly centralised nature of the government of the Sylean Federation was not suitable for a large, star spanning empire.

Cleon decided the Federation had served its purpose, and he began plans for a more suitable form of interstellar government, which would allow greater local autonomy but maintain cohesion over large distances. In addition, to restore the past glories of the Rule of Man (and therefore lay claim to all former territories of the First and Second Imperiums), Cleon proposed to revive the Imperium.

This was made possible by the fact that in the closing years of the period known as Twilight, one of the last claimants to the throne of the Rule of Man had made Sylea his capital. Cleon traced the legitimacy of the Sylean Federation back through this emperor to the Rule of Man and (since the Rule of Man claimed to be the lawful successor to the Vilani Imperium) to the First Imperium as well.

In the 651st year of the Sylean Federation, the Grand Senate of the Federation "persuaded" Cleon to accept the Imperial crown. That year he was crowned First Emperor of the Third Imperium, and he proclaimed the 651st year of the Sylean Federation to be the Year Zero of the Third Imperium.

System Defence Boat

A nonstarship specifically intended for defensive operations inside a star system. Developed on the principle that a nonstarship (because of the increased armament made possible by its lack of jump drives) can normally defeat a starship of equal tonnage. System Defence Boats are typically stationed at the vital points of a system (the gas giants, the asteroid belt, the major world, and so on), and they attack invading vessels according to one or more predetermined plans.

System defence boats range in size from displacements of 100 to 5000 and are constructed at all tech levels from eight to fifteen. There are hundreds of different types, tailored to their specific mission.

Terra
(Solomani Rim/Sol 1827 A867A69-F)

Also known as Earth. Origin of the genetic stock from which all races of humaniti descended, former capital of the Terran Confederation, former capital of the Old Earth Union, and former capital of the Solomani Autonomous Region. The word Terran (used to refer to an inhabitant of this world or to a citizen of the Terran Confederation) is derived from the name of this world.

^^^^

Terran Confederation
(-2398 to - 2204)

Interstellar government consisting of Terra ( Sol  / Solomani Rim 1827) and its colony worlds.

The United Nations and UNSCA
The Terran Confederation has its roots in the formation of the United Nations Space Coordination Agency (UNSCA) in -2508 (2010 AD), and the Treaty of New York, signed in -2499 (2019 AD). Essentially, the treaty placed the armed forces of the major nations of Terra ( Sol  / Solomani Rim 1827) under the centralized control of the United Nations (UN), until that time a loose organisation of the nation states of Terra ( Sol  / Solomani Rim 1827), with no governmental authority.

In addition, the treaty formalized the changes that had been made in the structure of the United Nations up to that time. The Secretary General was granted a wider range of executive powers than before. The Secretariat, previously an unofficial advisory group of representatives from the major nation-states, was made the chief legislative body. The General Assembly was retained, but it was an institution without real power and served merely as a forum for debate among the representatives of both major and minor nations. The Security Council was dispensed with altogether.

Jump Drive and First Contact
In addition to handling mundane responsibilities that helped avoid conflict, UNSCA soon became a clearing house for space operations. One of UNSCAs natural directions was research. In -2431 (2087 AD), UNSCA researchers in the systems asteroid belt who were looking for better drives to transport ores discovered jump drive. The first jump drives were used only in the solar system - they were too weak to be used for interstellar travel.

In -2422 (2096 AD), for various reasons, the first interstellar jump expedition travelled to Barnards Star ( Sol  / Solomani Rim 1926) rather than Alpha Centauri ( Sol  / Solomani Rim 2027?). Upon their return in -2421 (2097 AD), the expedition members were hurried into a hushed meeting with UNSCA. The expedition had encountered alien intelligent life - humans no less! The expedition members had encountered a Vilani prospecting outpost, an outpost on the very fringe of a vast, advanced empire controlled by alien humans. It came as quite a shock to the Terrans that many of the worlds only a few parsecs away were already claimed. Politicians echoed the popular sentiment that it was unfair for alien humans from several hundred light-years away to claim worlds near Terra ( Sol  / Solomani Rim 1827). Individual nations began expanding their armed forces and building starships.

Formation of the Terran Confederation
Over the course of the next three decades, UNSCA and the UN transformed itself into a true world government, which administered the defense of Terra against the Vilani Empire. Representatives from the Terran colonies formed on other worlds were granted membership into the General Assembly of the United Nations. In -2400, the UN officially changed its name to the United Worlds. Two years later, the name was changed again to the Terran Confederation (-2398 / 2120 AD). Modern historians, for simplicity, use this term exclusively.

The Terran Confederation fought a series of interstellar wars with the Vilani Imperium over the period -2408 to -2219. These wars ultimately resulted in the fall of the Vilani Grand Imperium. The Confederation was dissolved in -2204 upon the proclamation of the Rule of Man to replace the Vilani Imperium.

Terran Prime
Terran Norm

Designation used in astrographical surveys of unpopulated regions. These worlds are similar to Terra, and as such are much prized as possible habitations. To be classed as such, the following must be true: Diameter 8640 to 15200 km, atmosphere 4 to 9, hydrographic percentage 36 to 95%, gravity 0.6 to 1.1g. Within this is the category Terra Norm (diameter 9440 to 15200 km, atmosphere 6 or 7, hydrographic percentage 46 to 75, and gravity 0.75 to 1.1g), a classification which almost guarantees successful colonization.

Terran Prime (T-prime) worlds are worlds similar to the Terran standard type; such worlds are highly prized as habitations. To be classed as Terran Prime, a world's physical characteristics must fall within the following ranges:

Size 6 - 9 
Atmosphere 4 - 9 
Hydrography 3 - 9 
Gravity 0.6 - 1.1G 

Within this category is the Terran Norm (T-norm) type:

Size 7 - 9 
Atmosphere 6 - 7 
Hydrography 5 - 7 
Gravity 0.75 - 1.1G 

This latter classification almost guarantees successful colonisation or tourist industries.

Note that the actual UPP of Terra ( Sol / Solomani Rim 1827) is A-867A69-F.

Third Frontier War
(979 to 986)

The long period of uneasy peace between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate erupted into war in 979 with simultaneous blows by the Zhodani in the Querion and Jewell subsectors. Imperial reaction was deficient, and the hostilities continued for nearly six years with little to show for it. The armistice finally signed in 986 gave each side little, and it brought about the abdication of Emperor Styryx in 989. Third Imperium (0 to present): Also called The Imperium.

Founded in 0 by Cleon Zhunastu from the Sylean Federation in what is now Core sector. The Imperium grew swiftly during the pacification campaigns and more slowly thereafter until stability was reached in the 600's, by
which time the Imperium had absorbed much of the territory of the First and Second Imperiums.

Government Structure: The Imperium can best be thought of as a form of feudal confederation. Member worlds of the Imperium agree to pay taxes and obey a few fundamental laws which the Imperium promulgates, known as the High Laws. In return, the Imperium agrees to patrol the space between the worlds, to protect interstellar trade, to encourage travel and commerce, and to arbitrate diplomatic relations between worlds. Beyond this, individual worlds are left to their own devices so long as they acknowledge the power of the Imperium to rule the space between the stars.

Imperial power is present on the member worlds in the form of consulates, bureaucratic offices, and bases. Sometimes, larger enclaves of Imperial power are placed where they can enhance the Emperor's strength.

The Imperium's territory is divided into sectors, which are in turn divided into subsectors and systems. Groups of sectors, called domains, have been created above the sector level.

During the Pacification Campaigns, Emperor Artemsus divided chartered space into six regions, labeled them domains, and appointed an archduke over each of them. To each archduke, he assigned the continuing pacification of the domain's many systems and their integration into the Imperium. The domains were: Sylea (Core, Fornast, lassila, Delphi), Vland (Corridor, Vland, Gushemege, Dagudashag), Gateway (Ley, Glimmerdrift Reaches, Gateway, Crucis Margin), Ilelish (Ilelish, Zarushagar, Reaver's Deep, Daibei), Antares (Lishun, Antares, Mendan, Amdukan), and Sol (Diaspora, Old Expanses, Solomani Rim, Alpha Crucis). Most of the domains were never totally absorbed into the Imperium.

In 589, during the First Frontier War, a seventh domain was established: Deneb (Spinward Marches, Deneb, Trojan Reach, Reft). The intent was to appoint an archduke to be responsible for their supervision. However, the Civil War broke out before an archduke was appointed.

Following the civil war, the emperors expressed concern about individuals with powers equaling their own, so they moved to lessen the power of the archdukes in the Imperial government. Because of this, no Archduke of Deneb was ever  appointed. As a result, the domains came to have little practical significance. Each archduke did retain the power to create knights and baronets.

In the years after the Fourth Frontier War, and the problems it presented from lags in communication, Emperor Strephon felt that a strengthened archduke position could enable the Imperium to more quickly respond in the defense of the realm. Against the protests and opposition of prominent members of the Moot, Strephon has reinstituted a number of powers to the domains, most notably the right to collect taxes.

Thoengling Empire

Large, centralized state in the Vargr Extents. The Thoengling Empire is one of the most stable of the Vargr states and has existed in its current form since 792. The Emperor, who has great governmental authority, is chosen for life by vote of an elected assembly; by law, no member of the emperor's family may succeeded them. Sons and daughters of the higher nobility are brought up at the Imperial court, where every effort is made to inculcate personal loyalty to the Emperor.

The Thoengling Empire has become a major trading partner of the Imperium and generally supports Imperial interests in the Vargr Extents.

Trade Routes

Routes which jump-capable starships travel between major worlds and which connect vital suppliers with essential markets, important government worlds with high population worlds, and strategic resources with exploiting industry. Trade routes are a natural outgrowth of economic and market pressures. When a market is no longer profitable, the trade routes bypass it.

The trade routes are typically the territory of the Imperium's largest trading companies. They maintain fleets of commercial transports and merchants who serve these trade worlds, and they reap large profits in doing so.

But trade routes directly serve fewer than a tenth of the worlds of the Imperium. The other 90 percent of the Imperium's worlds are served by feeder lines, tramp freighters, and free traders. These smaller companies and unscheduled ships carry passengers and cargo between worlds off the main trade routes.

^^^^

Trade Station

Establishment for the promotion of interstellar commerce. There is no single controlling agency for trade stations; some are established by private companies, on their own, or on contract to the Imperium, some are run by the scout service, and others are operated by different branches of the Imperial government.

^^^^

Tranian

Archduke of Gateway. As archduke of the domain with the smallest proportion of territory actually within the Imperium, Tranian's dynasty was always the least powerful of the archduke dynasties. However, following the Civil War, this domain's powers were the least diminished by succeeding emperors. This was largely due to the fact that no emperor of the flag came from this region, and the armed forces of the region remained on the side of the Imperium instead of any particular emperor.

Tranian has few duties in the domain which cannot be administered from Capital, where he resides for most of the year. He is a powerful voice for tradition and honor in the Moot, and so the Imperium as a whole.

Trake

Small berry common to many worlds of the Imperium. the trake has a meaty, sweet body enclosing a single large seed and grows on a low, thorny bush. Trakes have grown in the Imperial Core since the time of the First Imperium. Introduced late to the Spinward larches, they have flourished on only a few worlds, most notably Pysadi and Alell, although they are cultivated on many others.

Traveller News Service

The major news agency of the Imperium, owned by the Travellers' Aid Society. TNS has bureaus on most major worlds throughout the Imperium and representatives at most starports.

Travel Zone

Standard form of classification for worlds in terms of relative danger. As a service to spacefarers, the Traveller's Aid Society publishes travel zone classifications that indicate the degree of danger a world presents to visitors. Standard classifications are green (no danger), amber (caution advised), and red (severe danger).

Trojan Points

In a gravitational system composed of a small body orbiting a much larger one (such as a planet and star or a moon and planet), there are two stable points lying in the small body's orbit 60 degrees ahead and behind it, and thus equidistant from the small and large bodies. These are called Trojan Points (also LaGrangian points, which are abbreviated as L4 and L5).

The Trojan points of of a gas giant near an asteroid belt commonly collect a cluster of asteroids. The name comes from the first such cluster discovered by Terrans at Jupiter in the Sol system; the asteroids are named after mythical heroes of the Trojan war.

Trokh

Language of the Aslan race, constant throughout all Aslan worlds, except for a few isolated colonies. This has done much to offset the effects of clan rivalry on interstellar commerce within the Hierate, and diplomatic relations With other interstellar states.

Tukera Lines
LIC

Tukera Lines operates a vast fleet of passenger and freight vessels throughout the Imperium, following the Xboat lines. In some subsectors (particularly the older, more established regions of the Imperium) Tukera Lines has a virtual monopoly on long distance shipping and travel.

Tukera Lines actually predates the formation of the Imperium. The original corporation held a charter from the Sylean Federation (family tradition holds that the company is several centuries older). With the establishment of the Imperium in the Holiday Year Zero, all such charters were automatically recognised by the Imperium.

Tukera Lines concentrates on the main communication links within the Imperium, and operates a vast fleet of jump-3 and jump-4 liners and transports which follow the established xboat routes. In some subsectors (especially the older, more established regions of the Imperium) Tukera has a virtual monopoly on long distance shipping and travel. Throughout the Imperium, all long-haul transport lines regard Tukera as their primary competitor.

Current Owner: Count Blaine Trulla Tukera and his two brothers.

In the Spinward Marches Tukera runs passenger and freight services between all the worlds on the xpress boat routes. In support of these operations, the company also owns marketing facilities, shipyards, ports and even staff training colleges. Their most extensive holdings are the transport company based in Aramis subsector, which is wholly owned by Tukera. The corporation uses its Imperium wide connections to provide highly profitable markets for the unusual products of the subsectors.

Stock Ownership: Tukera family, 6%; Imperial Family, 32%; large corporations, 6%; investment trusts, 25%; public (individuals) 25%.

Twilight
(-1776 to -1526)

The failure of the Rule of Man triggered the collapse of most interstellar civilization. while interstellar travel and commerce continued, it was at a greatly reduced rate, and the many worlds of the Imperium turned in on themselves. The period of collapse is termed Twilight, and it lasted for two and a half centuries.

Modern historians consider Twilight to have begun in -1776 when the treasury on Hub/Ershur refused to acknowledge a monetary issue of the branch treasury at Antares, which triggered a financial collapse and the destruction of large- scale trade within the Imperium.

The end of Twilight is commonly accepted as the year -1526, when the last government claiming to be the Rule of an ceased to exist.

Twilight's Peak

Legendary or apocryphal story of lost starfarers on an unknown world who discover fantastic structures and devices while surviving a terrible winter. Phrased as an epic poem of execrable quality, the story is most notable only in that it is based on fact: the Gyro Cadiz task force was lost in 984 (within the time period specified) and it has not been recovered or accounted for.

Two Thousand Worlds

Most common name in the Imperium for the region of space ruled by the K'kree. "Two Thousand Worlds" is a literal translation of the K'kree T't'tkahk Xeng ICirr. The same words can also be rendered idiomatically as "universe". In past times, the words meant "night sky",as roughly two thousand stars can be seen from one hemisphere of Kirur, the K'kree homeworld. The name should not be taken to mean that there are exactly two thousand systems in the K'kree empire.

The K'kree government is highly conservative. The current dynasty ruling the Two Thousand Worlds has been in power since prehistoric times, and the form of the government has remained unchanged except for a few minor modifications made necessary by the problems inherent in governing an interstellar empire.

K'kree expansion into space progressed very slowly after the discovery of the jump drive in -4142. The conservative nature of society and the technical limitations placed upon spaceflight by that society (K'kree spaceships must be very large, for example) combined to inhibit early exploration and colonization.

The discovery of other sophonts caused a xenophobic reaction in k'kree society. The realization that intelligent carnivores might exist somewhere in space sparked the K'kree obsession to convert the universe to herbivorism. This obsession stimulated the growth of the Two Thousand Worlds to its present size and still dominates K'kree culture. Local cultures are tolerated and other aspects of K'kree society are not heavily enforced, but all races within the Two Thousand Worlds are herbivorous.

K'kree contact with the Hive Federation was soon followed by the Hiver-K'kree war of -2029 to -2013. The military technology of the K'kree proved superior in the first stages of the war. The war ended due to nonmilitary considerations, however, when the Hive Federation demonstrated a plan to radically alter the 'kree social order through the the use of psychohistorical techniques and threatened to implement it. The K'kree withdrew to the antebellum borders, and the border between the to states has remained stable to this day.

The K'kree Empire eventually stopped in its expansion. Increasing problems of administration over interstellar distances and contact with other starfaring races (such as hivers and humaniti) have stabilized the Two Thousand Worlds at its present size.

United Nations
(-2573 to -2400)

An association of Terran states. Established in -2573 on the signing of the UN charter by the fifty member states at San Francisco. The organization was intended to reduce conflict and hardship on the world by encouraging cooperation between world powers. Duties were mainly carried out through UN agencies, but occasionally military force was employed with the support of the member states on the Security Council.

From about -2520, the UN started reforming into a world government. The armed forces of the major states became more accepted as a world-wide peacekeeping and police force under the banner of the United Nations. The Secretariat began coordinating large scale projects to reduce the effects of famine, disease, and economic hardship. Environmental controls and the move of many industrial concerns to orbital and out- system locations prevented Terra from loosing its garden climate. In addition, research was encouraged, and the solar system was intensively explored.

In -2499, the Treaty of New York formalized the changes in the UN's structure which had already occurred. The armed forces of the major nations were placed under centralized control. The Secretary General was granted wider executive powers. The Secretariat, previously an unofficial advisory group of representatives from the major nation-states, was made the chief legislative body. The General Assembly was retained, but became a forum for debate with little real power. The Security Council was dispensed with entirely. In addition, several new and powerful agencies were established. Among these were the United Nations Space Coordination Agency (UNSCA), the United Nations Diplomatic Integration Agency (UNIA), and the United Nations Trade Services Association (UNTSA).

Following the discovery of jump drive, and the establishment of extra-system colonies, these three agencies became the major arms of the interstellar government. On the admission of colonial representatives to the General Assembly in -2400, the organization changed its name to the United Worlds.

United Worlds
(-2400 to -2398)

Name adopted by the Terran based interstellar government in the interim period between the first colonial representatives taking their places on the General Assembly, and the first colonial state to gain a place on the Secretariat. Despite this seemingly rapid integration of the colonies, they remained in the minority. Thus throughout the government's history, Terran representatives (and so Terran interests) dominated the General Assembly and the Secretariat. The admission of colonials to the Secretariat in -2398 prompted the second change in the state's name, to the Terran Confederation.

Vargr

Intelligent major race derived from Ancient genetic manipulations of Terran carnivore/chaser stock, which apparently dates from approximately the same time that humaniti was scattered to the stars.

Inhabiting a region rimward of the Imperium, the Vargr were a puzzle to xenologists. The biochemistry and genetic makeup are almost identical with a number of terrestrial animals, but they differ radically from most of the flora and fauna indigenous to Lair, which is the purported Vargr home world.

Research during the early years of the Third Imperium concluded them to be the result of genetic manipulation of transplanted Terran animals of the family Canidae, almost certainly of genus Canis. The obvious conclusion, supported by archaeological evidence, is that the race known as the Ancients was responsible.

The typical Vargr is about 1.6 meters in height and weighs approximately 60 kilograms. They are upright, bipedal carnivores, with rear limbs digitigrade and hands very similar in size and appearance to those of a human, although there are significant internal differences. They have approximately the same physical parameters as humans and are able to use the same equipment without modification or additional instruction.

On average their reactions are slightly faster than those of the typical human, but individuals vary widely. The Vargr senses of smell and sight are superior to those of humans.

Government: There is no central Vargr government; indeed, there is no governmental type that can be said to be "typically vargr". Every conceivable form of governmental organization can be found somewhere in the Vargr Extents. The only cohesive force in the Extents is a fierce racial pride which causes a slight tendency towards racial cooperation.

The higher the level of the Vargr government, the more unstable it becomes because of the difficulty of obtaining consent of all Vargr involved.

Vargr in the Imperium: While only a few planets populated completely by Vargr exist within the Imperium, there are millions of Vargr citizens of loyal subject planets. Additionally, Vargr adventurers, criminals, mercenaries and traders can be found throughout the coreward reaches of the Imperium.

Society
The key elements shaping Vargr societies are a very strong centrifugal force resulting from an emphasis on personal leadership and a deeply ingrained family-group-race loyalty and an equally strong centripetal force resulting from acceptance only of informal lines of authority, an a constant competition for power between the more charismatic members of a group.

Centralized authority is extremely limited at the upper levels of Vargr society, and action is based on broad coalition concerns, with a constant splitting and rejoining by dissident factions. Traditionally, this has made it very difficult for more centralized and organized societies such as the Imperium to deal on a meaningful basis with what passes for Vargr states.

The Vargr have little respect for formal authority, and what respect they might have decreases as that authority becomes more remote. Vargr tend to respect informal authority figures more, and they obey superiors who are better known to them.

The Vargr have an intensive racial pride, and they are easily insulted. They are prone to enter fights without regard to possible consequences. Vargr social organization is difficult to characterize in Terran terms, but it can be most closely compared to the Dakota Sioux of North America in c. -2700, if the analogy is not pressed too far.

Even within the most stable Vargr governments, a highly charismatic leader can attract followers for almost any cause. The neighbors of the Vargr are constantly subject to impromptu raids and scattered piracy by bands of Vargr (totally without government sanction) who have been talked into a raid, a battle, or a war by a charismatic leader.

Vargr Campaigns
(220 to 348)

The series of wars, encounters, conflicts, and disputes between the Imperium and the various Vargr states in Vland, Corridor, and Deneb sectors along the coreward edge of the Imperium.

As the Imperium expanded, it initially recruited worlds that were former members of the First and Second Imperium. As its borders reached still farther, the Imperial expansion met already established Vargr states of varying sizes. The Imperium struggled for over a century to secure its territory against the Vargr; the inevitable series of conflicts that resulted are collectively called the Vargr campaigns.

^^^^

Vargr Extents

The territory dominated by Vargr governments. The term Vargr Extents refers to those sectors with major Vargr populations. The Extents are situated roughly coreward of the Imperium and especially coreward of the Spinward Marches, Deneb, Corridor, and Vland sectors.

Vegan

Intelligent minor race originating on Muan Gwi ( Vega / Solomani Rim 1717). They were named by Solomani humans after the bright star near their homeworld.

Physiology

Vegans are upright, bipedal, and bilaterally symmetrical, averaging 2.2m in height. They are bisexual, homeothermic oxygen breathers with an average lifespan of over 200 years. Because of their low-gravity origin, they are physically quite weak, and are unable to live on high-gravity worlds.

The head serves both as braincase and sensory appendage. Auditory organs are located in a collar-like structure around the neck. Despite external appearances to the contrary, Vegans have two eyes, located inside the hood-like fleshy structure which dominates the head. The paired eyes are covered by a single transparent eyelid-like structure, which acts as a polarized light filter. This structure protects the eyes from glare, like built-in sunglasses, and also serves to keep windblown dust out of the eyes. This filter can be retracted when not needed. The eyes themselves are large, and pick up radiation well into the infrared portion of the spectrum, an adaptation to Muan Gwi's small red sun. Since the skull is solidly fixed in place, a Vegan cannot turn its head, but the fleshy hood containing the eyes can turn through a large arc.

The mouth is a vertical slit in the upper thoracic region, with paired breathing/vocal slits on either side of it. Two mandibles are located inside the upper chest, and grind food between their opposing sets of teeth.

Where the forearm and hand would be on a human, Vegans have three tentacles, which serve them as manipulative organs. Their legs end in broad, splayed feet, which prevent them from sinking into soft sand.

The urogenital opening is a vertical slit located ventrally in the lower abdomen. There are no external differences between the sexes.

Vegans have a number of adaptations to the arid dry region of Muan Gwi where they developed. Their tall, thin bodies are designed for maximum radiation of heat. The torso is covered with a thick integument, whose convoluted surface is richly supplied with blood vessels. By increasing or decreasing the supply of blood to the integument, heat radiation from the torso can be regulated to optimum effect (more during the day, less at night). This arrangement obviates the necessity for sweating and its consequent water loss. All orifices of the body can be sealed to prevent unnecessary moisture loss.

History

The Vegans received the jump drive about -6000 from Vilani-influenced traders, and colonised several nearby worlds before being absorbed into the First Imperium in -4404. They were severely restricted under Vilani rule, as were all races who resisted being intergrated into the rigid Vilani culture. Thus, they welcomed Terran victory in the Interstellar Wars and the advent of the Rule of Man. The Vegan Polity prospered under the Rule of Man and survived the Long Night largely intact. However, with the advent of the Third Imperium, the Vegan area was broken into individual planetary states in accordance with Imperial policy; non-humans were treated as full citizens, but in order to cement Imperial authority, no multiworld governmental units were allowed.

The creation of the Solomani Autonomous Region in 704 once again restricted the Vegans. Human colonies were founded on many Vegan worlds to maintain Solomani influence there, and Solomani governors were installed on all Vegan worlds. After the Solomani Rim War, the Vegan Autonomous District was formed as a counterweight to the Solomani Confederation.

Society

Vegan society is divided into hundreds of different tuhuir, which might be roughly translated as culture, philosophy, or tao. Each tuhuir has its own customs and traditions, and its own interpretation of the proper way to live. The civil service which governs the Vegan District is a tuhuir which oversees and mediates amoung all the other tuhuir. Although rare, heretical and rebellious tuhuir do exist.

Archeology shows that tuhuir were once separate societies, each associated with a particular people and geographic location, like countries on ancient Earth. Now, however, they are mixed together in complex patterns.

Tuhuir are not hereditary; when a Vegan nears sexual maturity, he or she enters a period of search, which may last for many years. Eventually the individual chooses a tuhuir; once made, the choice is for life. In practice, about 50% of Vegans choose the tuhuir of their parents (the exact percentage varies with each tuhuir); abour 0.5% find that they enjoy the search as a way of life and never join a tuhuir.


^^^^

Vegan Automonous District

A region of space controlled by a single centralised government run by the Vegans, a roughly humanoid race originating on Muan Gwi ( Vega / Solomani Rim 1717).

After its pyrrhic victory in the Solomani Rim War, the Imperium found that it could not continue its advance into the Solomani Sphere, and declared an indefinite armistice. The Imperial high command created the Vegan Autonomous District to act as a counterweight to the remnants of the Solomani Confederation. The Vegans have complete internal control over their District, but free passage is guaranteed for Imperial citizens and goods.

Although many factors have contributed to the present peace and stability along the Solomani Rim, it cannot be denied that the creation of the District has achieved its original purpose.

The worlds of the District are under a single, centralised government. State power is contained in a civil service, chosen and promoted by competitive examinations. Within this common state, the Vegans are culturally diverse. Society is divided into hundreds of different tuhuir, which might be roughly translated as culture, philosophy, or tao. Each tuhuir has its own customs and traditions, and its own interpretation of the proper way to live. Tuhuir are not hereditary; a Vegan chooses to join one after a period of search. The civil service which governs the District is a tuhuir which oversees and mediates among all the other tuhuir.

Vilani

Human major race (H. sapiens) that developed on Vland from human stock placed there by the Ancients.

History
The world of Vland, while possessed of a hospitable environment, boasted an alien ecology based on its own independently evolved biology, a biology that produced amino acids, proteins, and sugars that were difficult for humans to digest and metabolize. The humans just could not use local plant and animal life for food.

One of the oldest occupations in Vilani society is that of shugilii (which translates roughly as miller). The shugilii was a person who could transform raw food into edible food through special aging and chemical treatments. The shugilii position was more akin to that of shaman or witch doctor than that of cook. Since virtually no food on Vland was edible without some treatment, shugilii were powerful members of society.

The alienness of land was reciprocal: humans were unsuitable as food for predators, parasites died because humans provided no nutrition, bacteria could not infect the human system, and even viruses were unable to invade and take over  human cells. Consequently, the primitive human society found no need for medically oriented shaman. Vilani medical understanding was very slow to develop because of this.

Vilani legends are full of accounts of the wars of the gods, terrible destruction, and occasional intervention in human affairs by the gods. Legends exist of early explorers who found lands with great living stone-metal gods possessed of immense magical powers. Modern archaeologists now believe these "gods" were actually great robot warriors and juggernauts used by the ancients in the final war. Apparently, the last of these machines finally ran down around -20,000.

Society
Early Vilani society was dominated by three groups: the shugilii, the aristocrats, and the merchants. Aristocrats were the natural leaders of society, the shugilii were the all important food processors, and the merchants controlled trade.

With the flowering of Vilani society (circa -11,000) and its attendant industrial revolution, each of these three forces gained power rather than lost it; each participated in the creation of the industrialized wealth of Vland.

In -9235 the Vilani made their ultimate breakthrough, one that would assure their ascendence for the next 6000 years. A research team working on the fringes of the Vland system created the first working prototype jump drive and demonstrated its effects.

The Vilani discovered intelligent lifeforms on other worlds within 60 parsecs of Vland. None of the races had progressed enough to have begun interstellar travel. The Vilani found it easy to dominate these less technically advanced races. The Vilani were able to impose Vilani culture and law on these other races among the stars. However, the Vilani conquering was not of a militaristic nature, but was economic subjugation.

As their sphere of influence was expanding, the Vilani found it difficult to maintain control across such great distances with jump-l their maximum rate of travel and communication. At the same time, each of the three power classes of the Vilani society found themselves threatened by the forces around it.

Three bureaus were established, each independent of the other two, and each assigned a territory among the stars for which it was responsible. Each of the three bureaus was effectively identical, but they initially espoused different philosophies, which were based on their origins. The bureaus maintained their own governments within their territories.

Silarurshid, originating with the merchant class, emphasized interstellar trade. lakhidkarhn, originating with the aristocracy, emphasized interstellar government. Naasirka, originating with the shugilii, floundered after it found that it could not control food supplies on most worlds it dealt with, but it ultimately became a broad based organization, emphasizing energy, transport, and luxury goods.

In -5430, the Vilani finally discovered jump-2. No other race had jump-2, and the Vilani maintained its monopoly on jump-2 by jealously guarding its secrets from all subject races.

Beginning in -5400, a series of wars to subjugate the resisting fringe cultures was waged. This period of consolidation lasted until -4045.

Grand Empire of Stars: In -4045, the ruling Vilani council, the Igsiirdi, declared the Grand Empire of Stars, or in the Vilani tongue the Ziru Sirka. The Vilani calendar starts on this date.

At first, the Empire had no emperor. Within 10 years, the chairman of the Igsiirdi (elected for life by the council) was declared the Isilimkarun, the Shadow Emperor, Who ruled by published proclamation, but never appeared in public. In -3610, the Shadow Emperor became Emperor of the Stars, who was absolute monarch of the Empire. Successors were elected from the Igsiirdi upon the death of the old emperor.

For nearly 1,200 years the Grand Empire of Stars Kept peace among its star spanning population. however, the empire insisted on cultural rigidity. Exploration was brought to a halt by -4000. Scientific research was controlled and then stopped altogether by -300.

The beginning of the end of Vilani domination, however, was emphasized when the Terrans contacted the empire in -2422. By - 240 the Terrans and the Vilani were at war; by -2219 the Terrans had surpassed the Vilani technology and were marching through the cities of Vland as conquerors, and the Grand Empire of Stars was at an end.

Currently, Vilani is a cultural rather than racial or national labeling, and it is applied to those within the Imperium who retain some of the old ways. Dialects of the old High Vilani language survive in certain places, along with a few other fragments of Vilani culture, such as musical forms and other fine arts. Certain of the old Vilani noble families have maintained more of the old culture. In particular, those who control the Vilani megacorporations instill a predominantly Vilani culture on many of their employees.

Vilani Calendar

The Vilani calendar is based on the period of Vland (the Vilani homeworld) around Urakkalan, its star. The Vilani Gurkala (year) is 478.72 standard days in length.

Vilani

The group of languages derived from the official language of the Ziru Sirka. In modern times there are three versions common throughout the Imperium. Old High Vilani has a similar status to that of Latin on pre-stellar Terra; many Vilani-based languages of Imperial worlds are closely related to this language. Secondly, there is Classical Written Vilani. Used in the Ziru Sirka to help surmount the difficulties of language differences which emerged across the vast distances of that empire, its spelling, grammar, etc remained constant throughout the empire, even when pronunciation varied. Finally, there is Modern Vilani, still used as a first language on many Imperial worlds. It is this form that members of Imperial service are required to have a working knowledge of. The language has three sub-languages; one for speaking to ones' social superiors (Inferior), one for speaking to ones' social inferiors (Superior), and a third for use only with family members, pets, and close, life-long friends.

Vland
(Vland/Vland 1717 A967A9A-F)

Homeworld of the Vilani, former capital of the Vilani Imperium, current capital of the Vland sector. Vland is a major trade and cultural center for the coreward/spinward regions of the Imperium.

Way Station

Link in the express boat network. The way station is a large (for the Scout Service) base devoted to the overhaul and refit of express boats at points in their journeys. During a normal tour of duty, an express boat will jump from system to system, and occasionally change pilots, but steadily work its way farther and farther down the line.

At each stop (Xboat station), the Xboat is routinely checked, refuelled, reprovisioned, and sometimes recrewed. Ultimately, however, the Xboat must undergo maintenance and possible repair after the rigors of its mission. The way station performs this function.

Way stations have stocks of scout-oriented repair and maintenance equipment, as well as trained staffs of service personnel. They are the equivalent of naval bases, although they are capable of servicing only smaller displacement ships (10000 and less) due to the size and orientation of their facilities.

^^^^

Xboat Station

Facility for handling Xboats at a star system. At each system served by the Xboat network, an express boat station is maintained to handle the message traffic and to manage incoming and outgoing Xboats.

Usually located near the edge of a star system, the station picks up messages beamed to it by incoming Xboats and relays the data to the local world for delivery. Messages destined for worlds farther down the line are transmitted to a waiting Xboat which jumps for the next world in the network.

The Xboat station contains receiving and retransmitting equipment; refuelling and support facilities for the local staff and waiting crews are also provided. The Xboat station maintains a local office on the system's major world for the acceptance of Xboat messages, as well as to handle delivery of the messages to addresses on the world.

^^^^

Xboat Tender

These 1000-ton displacement vessels are intermediaries between Xboats boats and their stations. They retrieve the Xboats, prepare them for their next jump and provide routine maintenance requirements. An internal Ship bay can hold up to four Express Boats, or two Scout/Couriers, and so are often used by the IISS as field repair workshops. In the more remote parts of the boat network, small groups of one to three such vessels act as the entire boat station with no permanent facility whatsoever. The Imperial Navy have pressed approximately 144 of these vessels into tanker duty, supporting fighter squadrons patrolling frontier worlds. They are also popular as bulk ore carriers and as corsairs, where the ship bay comes in useful for boarding procedures, allowing captured vessels to be stripped at leisure.

^^^^

Xmail

Information sent by Xboat. Also known as express mail and Imperial mail. Xboats carry information only (at least for their civilian customers); material objects may not be sent. Messages are digitally encoded; xmail costs Cr10 per 2 kilobytes per parsec. The message may be sent using a standard Galanglic character set (about CrlO for a 500 word message), or in classical written Vilani (about Cr10 for a 700 word message) or a picture may be reproduced as a facsimile (Cr2 for a 200 x 200 bit matrix). The message is printed out at its destination and delivered by a world's local mail service.

Some merchant companies operate an express Packet service, transporting small cargoes at speeds close to those of the Imperial boat network. These services are considerably more expensive than standard methods of cargo transport.

Year Zero

The base year of the Imperial calendar is the founding year of the Third Imperium. By selecting a base year numbered zero (instead of the generally selected year 1), the Imperial dating system became a standard number line extending backward in time.

Years before the founding of the Imperium become simple negative numbers, and the differences between dates before and after the founding of the Imperium can be determined by subtraction

Zdetl

Official language of the Zhodani Consulate, adopted as standard in -5718 (the 300th Olympiad). It is fairly constant throughout the consulate, the few dialects which exist arising primarily from the jargon of specific occupations, rather than a difference in language.

^^^^

Zhodane
(Zhodane 2719 A6547C8-F)

Capital of the Zhodani Consulate and homeworld of the Zhodani people. Unlike capitals of other interstellar states, Zhodane is largely divided into the estates of the members of the ruling Zhodani council, making the world's population unusually low. The three supreme Zhodani consuls, and the Grand Council, rule the Consulate from this world.

See also Zhodani.

^^^^

Zhodani

Human major race (H. sapiens) inhabiting the Zhodani Consulate, a region far spinward of the Imperium.

The Zhodani are a branch of Humaniti similar in most respects to other human races. In general, they tend to be taller than Solomani or Vilani, and lithe of build. Their most important difference is the acceptance and use of psionics. Zhodani society is divided into three classes: nobles, intendants, and proles. Nobles are the enfranchised ruling class, and receive psionic training from childhood. Intendants are the managers and administrators of society, and also receive early training. Proles constitute the masses, are forbidden the use of psionics, and do not receive training. Within this rigid class system, there are two opportunities for promotion to a higher class. All prole children are tested for psionic potential, and those showing high scores are taken from their families and adopted into the intendant class. Intendants are rewarded for great diligence, service to the state or victory in the psionic games, through the granting of noble rank.

The presence of psionics in the hands of those in power means that many aspects of society work at high efficiency. Psychology, behavioral science, communication science, and education are more refined and exact than in other societies. Educational methods are finely tuned, and capable of teaching concepts rapidly and accurately. Mental deviance or criminal tendencies can be detected early and corrected with facility.

Society
Zhodani society is generally a happy one. Individuals are members of a functioning whole, with each making a contribution to its success. The relative lack of upward mobility for the proles is offset by the possibility for their children to move upwards if they have the proper potential. The burden of responsibility imposed on on the intendants is lightened by the ever present possibility of reward through elevation to the noble classes. The nobles themselves temper their burden of authority with the comfort derived from their station in life.

Morality
The Zhodani have a general distaste for other human races which do not practice psionics. Effective indoctrination and the ever present possibility that one's mind is being read have removed dishonesty and deviance as common features of society. The tavrchedl (Thought Police) are a special branch of the government who are charged with maintaining correct thought in the population.

Imperial distaste for the Zhodani is founded on two facts. Firstly, the Zhodani practice psionics, and an Imperial cannot be sure that a Zhodani is not invading his mental privacy at any time. Imperials feel exposed and uncomfortable in the presence of Zhodani. Second, because of their psionic abilities, the Zhodani have the most effective authoritarian government in history. Imperial citizens, used to a great degree of local autonomy, fear Zhodani conquest because of the loss of freedom it would entail.

Government
The Zhodani Consulate is a participatory democracy in which only nobles are allowed to vote. Executive and judicial functions are the responsibility of a series of councils of varying sizes. Each council elects one of its number as executive officer, and a number of its members as delegates to the next higher council.

A city, for example, will elect several of its council members to be representatives to the world council. The process continues upward through several layers of councils to the overall Grand Council of the Zhodani. Nominally, each member of a council serves for one olympiad (three Zhodani years), but in practice each councillor serves until their replacement arrives and they are officially replaced, or until word of the delegate's re-election is received. Often, the district from which a councillor is elected will have only relatives as voters, and re-election is virtually assured.

Standard practice (when possible) calls for Zhodani councils to submit important questions to a plebiscite of those affected. The principle can be suspended where immediate action is required, but the official ordering the action stands responsible to the voters, and actions must be justified as soon as possible.

Supreme executive power is vested in three consuls, one elected each Zhodani year for a term of one olympiad by and from the members of the Grand Council. No consul may be elected twice in succession, and retired consuls become life members of the Grand Council.

History
Zhodani history is considered to properly begin with their arrival with the Ancients c. -300 000. However, the first documented evidence of a major culture on Zhodane is of a moon worshipping empire, ascendant between -1000 and -15000. Much of the elementary stone age knowledge was developed in this period.

The collapse of this empire lead to a dark age, until the emergence of a noble class and a feudal system c. -13000. The resultant encouragement of science and exploration resulted in settlement of much of Zhodane, and technological advancement to the point of elementary space flight. However, shortly afterwards a great plague decimated the population, and brought about a second dark age to the world. In the following period of recovery, psionics gained ascendance, and the development of the psionic aristocracy began.

The first psionic games were held in -6731, this being the first olympiad, and so the start of the Zhodani calendar. Space travel was reacquired, and the first sublight interstellar expeditions were mounted in c. -5000. Colonies were established on six worlds within four parsecs. In -523 the Zhodani Consulate was established between these worlds. Then, in -5415, jump drive was discovered.

The resulting expansion was gradual and uneventful. Although some states on the fringe resisted absorption into the Consulate, most were annexed peacefully. The Consulate first came into conflict with the expanding Imperium in the 500s, in disputes over the limits of present and future settlement of the Spinward Marches. The resulting Frontier Wars have done little to resolve the basic differences between the two empires.

Zhodani Calendar

The Zhodani calendar is based on the period of Zhodane around Plebor, its star. The Zhodani Shen (year) is 275.19 standard days (or 244.44 zhodanstial, Zhodane's day) in length, and is divided into six Shider of 40 zhodanstial, separated by one day holidays. Zhodani dating uses Thecuzodij (olympiad), which are three Shen. A Zhodani date is written as: Thecuzodij.Shen Slider/Zilodanstial, with special holiday names replacing the Shider/Zhodanstial where appropriate. For example 001-0000 Imperial (the date-the Imperium was founded) is equivalent to 2979.1 Atrint/7.

Zirunkariish

A Vilani banking and investment company. Unlike most other Vilani megacorporations, whose origins are shrouded in mystery, Zirunkariish is known to have been founded by the noble Vilani family of Shiishuginsa (a member of which, Antiama, married the emperor Zhakirov in 679) in the year -425.

Zirunkariish is one of the largest insurance underwriters in the Imperium, and while its capital reserves are gigantic, it usually chooses to invest them in various trusts rather than in other megacorporations. The megacorporation was a major source of the investment required for the expansion of the Sylean Federation into the Third Imperium.

Stock Ownership: Shiishuginsa- 29%, Imperial family- 18% Sharurshid trust-17%, Hortalez et Cie- 7%, Noble families- 12%, Investment trusts- 8%, Private ownership- 9%.

Zuchai Crystal

These crystals form the raw material for a vital focusing element in many designs of jump drive. They occur naturally, but can also be synthesized. However, natural crystals have a longer lifetime, and so command a higher price (around Cr1000 per kilogram).

Cinos Lines

Major Solomani shipping line operating in the Rim sector


Cinos diversifies, and its' operations range from small single-ship tramp crews to giant kiloton bulk traders. It's quite well known for not taking hijack or piracy attacks lightly, and its' security guards are famous. There is a strong rumour on the Imperial side of the border that said guards are trained by SolSec, something the company denies.

^^^^

SolSec 
(Solomani Security)

The Solomani Confederation's intelligence, political police and espionage force


Secret police force maintained in service to the Solomani Confederation for the purpose of maintaining state secrets, conducting espionage, and implementing political policies of the government.

Solomani Security maintains both a network of contacts which provide information from outside the Confederation and a network of informants which provide information within the Confederation. Solomani Security agents themselves are highly trained individuals capable of conducting espionage and sabotage.

Sulamar

Creature found on Ariel in the Solomani Rim


Sulamar are seven feet tall, with thick shaggy white fur, deep body fat, and small curled horns. They have the ability to match their body temperature to the environment, a useful trick as most of their prey creatures have the ability to detect body heat.

Dekan Teardrops

Dekan Teardrops, or Tears of Dekan, gems found (only) in the Aqilat belt in the Solomani Rim.


Very desirable for jewelry and ornamentation

Android

Artificially created organic being. Technically "a synthetic man, created from biological materials." They exhibit life, in that they are biologically living; their distinction is that they were created, rather than having evolved.

Androids are created from a combination of cloning and genetic engineering . At tech level 14, DNA chains can be synthetically tailored to create desired characteristics, which means androids can take any form. Their general inability to reproduce results from the laws of most high-tech worlds rather than from technology.

Susceptibility to premature aging and sickness at TL14 limits their lifespan to 10-15 years.

Ansing Expedition

Famous exploration of the accessable reaches of the gas giant Annikkittaar, Pretoria ( Pretoria / Deneb) system, in 870 to 884. Extensive use of specially designed exploration vessels, protective environment suits, and high technology equipment allowed the Ansing Foundation of Vland ( Vland / Vland 1717) to extensively map and explore the upper reaches of the gas giant's atmosphere.

Answerin

Intelligent minor race of humaniti, native to Answerin ( Parsi / Vland 0431). Their world orbits a close binary system of a G0 V and an A7 II star, whose combined ultraviolet light has stimulated melanin production in the race. All Answerin have dark brown or black skin tones. Hair is likewise dark, with wavy hair being the most common. To protect their eyes from the twin suns, the Answerin have evolved slight epicanthic folds. In some individuals, these folds give an almost squinting appearance, while others could best be described as looking sleepy.

The lower gravity of Answerin has made the humans there taller than most others. Average height is about 1.9m tall and they weigh about 75kg. They are fully interfertile with most other human races, but prefer to marry amoung their own kind. Cross-breeding does not usually occur. The offspring of any cross-racial matchings results in little or no genetic blending - the child is either fully Answerin or will resemble the other parent's race.

Answerin is a hot world, and the humans there have adapted their circadian rhythms to a more nocturnal existence. The local day is 25 hours long, which is generally divided into eight hours of sleep during the day, nine hours of work during the evening, and eight more hours of rest at night. Through time, the Answerin have evolved an aptitude for night vision that is superior to other humans; they can see clearly for 5 metres in the dark. Other senses are about average for humans in most respects.

The Answerin have developed an almost strictly vegetarian diet due to a shortage of highly developed animals on their homeworld. They are not militaristic or chauvinistic about their vegetarianism as are the K'kree; they are merly unused to eating meat and thus prefer a vegetarian diet. The native plant life of Answerin possesses a compatable biochemistry with humans, so there is no need for any extensive food preparation.

The Answerin believe in the ability of the human mind to overcome physical difficulties. Pain and fatigue result from a laxity of the mind, and anyone is capable of overcoming merely physical ills. By conquering the frontiers of the human psyche, the Answerin believe they will be better able to master themselves physically, and with that mastery comes freedom from the physical. Fear is looked on as a disease of the mind, which must be eradicated to better the human condition.

The Answerin are renown for their fighting skills. This renown goes back to the days of the Vilani Ziru Sirka when the Answerin were used as shock troops and marines. Their skill is partly due to their rejection of fear and its resultant weaknesses, but it rumoured to have a physiological basis.

Antebellum

Literally, "before the war". Generally, a historical term referring to the period within the Imperium prior to the Civil War. Specifically, the years 210 to 604, Imperial dating.

The antebellum period was characterised by expansion of the Imperium, with large-scale colonisation efforts, integration of numerous regions into Imperial society, and an overall mood of growth and exploration. With the end of the antebellum period, the Imperium turned more attention inward, devoting resources to internal development and consolidation.

Arkesh Spacers

A merchant company based in the rimward area of the Spinward Marches. Attracted to anything with a profit in it, Arkesh's competitors (Baraccai Technum and McClellan Factors) state it to be "a predatory outfit, on the thin line between accepted commercial practice and downright piracy".

With a nominal headquarters on Strouden / Lunion (0707), Arkesh Spacers eschew regular bases, instead relying on (often criminal) contacts on many Marcher worlds to provide custom and maintain their vessels.

All-Terrain Vehicle
ATV

ATV (artist Bryan Gibson, used with permission); click for original versionThe All-Terrain Vehicle is a wheeled or tracked vehicle designed to provide high-quality transportation on any number of worlds. It is intended for world surface exploration or transport across undeveloped areas. As such, an ATV can traverse all but the most forbidding terrain and is fully amphibious. The pressurised interior protects against vacuum and insidious atmospheres.

The standard ATV masses 10 HG tons and allows a payload of 6 tons (including driver and passengers). It may be powered by a battery, requiring solar recharging or a ship's power plant; more often it contains a small fusion plant. This requires refuelling with water or hydrogen every 24 hours, and so has a range of about 5000 km on good terrain. Wheeled versions cruise on-road at 60 kph, with a maximum speed of 100 kph on-road and 20 kph in rough terrain. Tracked versions cruise at 40 kph on-road, with a maximum of 80 kph on-road and 30 kph on rough terrain.

An ATV requires 1 driver and can carry up to 16 passengers. The vehicle contains complete (although cramped) eating, sleeping and travel facilities for 8 persons. The vehicle may be lightly armoured (factor-16) and can carry a turret mounting a laser or other local combat weapon.

Baraccai Technum

An interface line which operates in the rimward area of the Spinward Marches.

With its headquarters on Trin (Trin's Veil 3235), Baraccai Technum is influential throughout the rimward worlds of the Marches; its wealth rests firmly on manufacturing, transport and brokerage interests. However, by no means unimportant are entrepreneurial connections with worlds beyond the Imperium in the Outrim Void.

The primary rimward base of BT is at the BT Centre at Glisten (Glisten 2036). This base is responsible for the Extra-Imperium Activity (EIA) Division. Primary base for this division is Berengaria ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 2105); it includes an orbiting BT maintenance & repair station. Similar bases exist at Cyan ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 2102), Pax Rulin ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 2204), and Alexin ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 2405). All Imperial worlds in the subsector, except red-zoned Rhysk ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 2304), have some sort of BT trading presence.

BT normally maintains trade relations with independent worlds by appointing a factor, usually a BT company man, but occasionally a native of the planet. Apart from the usual warehouse, living quarters, office and so on, each factor also has a small emergency ship repair facility for the use of BT vessels. BT has factors on Candia ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 1801), Kydde ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 1810), Bantral ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 1906), Senlis ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 2108), Magen ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 2309), and at T'yana ( Egryn / Trojan Reach 1602).

Primary BT rivals are Arkesh Spacers and McClellan Factors. On T'yana, BT and MC rivalry is especially hot.

Battle Dress

Imperial Marine Assault Battledress, TL 15 (artist Bryan Gibson, used with permission) The ultimate in individual protection, battle dress is a powered, strength-enhancing exoskeletal suit, surrounded by a carapace of multiple-layered synthetic armour. It is an advanced version of combat armour.

An in-built IR-masking system selectively bleeds heat to match background radiation, effectively rendering the wearer invisible to IR sensors. In a cold environment, the suit stores heat internally until this compromises operator safety, at which point the on-board computer advises the operator to seek a safe place to dump the waste heat.

A chameleon surface covers the outer armour, allowing it to change colour on operator command. Standard patterns include arctic, city, desert, forest, jungle and space, although others can be programmed into the suit.

Integral power-packs last for days and the life-support systems provide a sealed, self-sufficient environment for a minimum of 12 hours.

Battle dress enhances the strength and senses of individuals wearing it with variable feedback controls, servo-powered limbs, and various kinds of electronic assistance. The individual wearing battle dress is effectively doubled in strength and given unlimited endurance (for lifting, carrying and fighting purposes; not for wounds received). The user can adjust the strength to the situation (up to a max UPP of 30), but only experienced operators (Battle Dress 2+) can use this feature without damaging the manipulated object, or even the suit.

Zero-friction bearings and sound-suppression equipment built into the system make this imposing machine eerily quiet (the user receives a DM of +2 for surprise).

A standard combat package includes a continental-range directional/scrambled communicator, a tactical battle computer (to manage targets, provide current situation displays, and handle communications to a co-ordinating tac computer), and an advanced sensor package (heads-up targeting, IR and LI telescopic visor, micro/macro viewing, and remote televiewing from other sources).

Modular add-ons include grav "belt", extended life support (up to 36 hours), and an ECM module. Some suits (generally assault suits) include armoured chest plates, drop capsule fittings, and smoke and prismatic aerosol dispensers.

No weapons are integral, but a visible computer socket/link is placed on the chest front at the right and left shoulders where a rifle would normally be placed. This allows modular weapons to be linked with the suit. Weapons are chosen to suit the type of mission. Typical weaponry includes a removable arm-mounted laser carbine or rifle, along with one of the following: gauss rifle; RAM grenade launcher; PGMP-13 or PGMP-14; FGMP-14 or FGMP-15; or a tac nuke launcher.

A special version of battle dress (Type D) exists for Dolphins.

Bilstein Yards

The Bilstein company of Glisten ( Glisten / Spinward Marches 2036) has achieved a high reputation for specialist starships of non-streamlined types. Though constructing on a small scale compared to builders like Ling Standard, Bilstein vessels are sought after due to their attention to customer's special requirements. Bilsteins are the major suppliers of private yachts to the March nobility and this provides the bulk of their output. Occasionally, however, a class of vessels such as the Leviathan-class merchant cruisers are turned out and several powered planetoid types have been constructed.

^^^^

Bionics
Replacement Body Parts

Prosthetics are mechanical body parts that are mass-produced, functional replacements. They are surgically installed by a medical professional, and are the most economical type of replacement body parts, available at TL 9+.

Bionics are mechanical body parts that are individually custom-designed replacements, with greater functionality than the original body part. Bionics are the most expensive type of replacement body part, available at TL 9+. Note that bionics also refers to a science concerned with applying data about the functioning of biological systems to solve engineering problems. The term cyborg is sometimes applied to a person with bionics.

Regrowth is a method of replacing body parts involving stimulating the body to regrow its missing part. At TL 9, missing limbs can be regrown, and at higher tech levels damaged non-vital organs can be regrown in place. Regrowth is more expensive (and time-consuming) than prosthetics, but is generally cheaper than cloning and bionics.

Cloning involves taking one or more cells from the donor and growing a replacement body part (not an entire clone) in an artificial womb. By TL 13, new body parts of any kind can be selectively cloned from the DNA of any body cell. Once grown, the new part is surgically attached to the donor. Cloning costs about the same as regrowth during the growing period, but surgical re-attachment of the new part is more expensive than any of the other options.

Black Globe Generator

Black globes typify the incomprehensible artifacts of the Ancients. Each is a shiny metallic cube measuring 300 cm on a side. Two minor discolorations on the surface are the on/off switches. When activated, the generator projects a force field that absorbs all forms of energy (including light, hence the characteristic black color of the field) in a sphere around the device. Applying energy expands the sphere.

Black globe generators have been converted into rudimentary force screens for some select Imperial Navy vessels. Matter cannot penetrate the screen, and energy impinging on the screen is absorbed within the ship's energy capacitors (giving a measure of control over the device) and the mechanism itself. When the screen is dropped, the energy radiates away as heat.

The generator has several disadvantages. First, there is a lack of any contact through the screen, which prevents maneuver drive from working and calls for inertial navigation. Second, fields big enough to encompass typical larger fighting craft have proved inherently unstable; there is a danger that the capacitors will overload with absorbed energy. The result is an explosion, caused by a transfer of the absorbed energy to the interior of the ship.

Crude duplicates have been produced, but scientists are still a long way from understanding how they work. Neither the copies nor the original artifacts are available outside of the Navy.

Superdense , Bonded SD , Coherent SD

A form of armor protection, superdense (SD) refers to a material that has had its molecular structure partially collapsed in a massive artificial gravity field (such as might be encountered in a white dwarf star), which increases its density and strength. Superdense becomes available at TL 12, and usually supplants previous materials used to armor starships and tanks.

Bonded superdense (BSD) is an improved form of superdense armor, with a small induced electronic current to strengthen the internal electron bonds which further increases strength. BSD provides the protection of SD for approximately half the weight, and becomes available at TL 14.

A theoretical further enhancement of superdense is coherent superdense, where bonded superdense armor is dynamically manipulated by input from the sensors and the computer so as to polarize the subatomic forces in the material's molecules, thereby presenting maximum penetration resistance to a specific striking force. Although experiments in this field are continuing, it is beyond the reach of current Imperial technology, and is postulated as being available at TL 17.

Bradeeva

Name often given when referring to a fictional ship.

Rumors exist that the Imperial Navy recovered an entire Ancient starship, the Bradeeva, floating derelict in space between two solar systems in the Massilia sector. These recurring rumours are not consistent in precisely which solar systems were involved, or in exactly when this find was made.

In 806, the principal Geonee ambassador to the Imperium, Duke Valreega Neowashee, sued the Imperial Navy in a fruitless attempt to reclaim the vessel as Geonee property. A special commission established by the Imperial Moot determined that there was no truth to the rumors and closed the case.

^^^^

Brinn

Intelligent xenophobic minor race native to the world of Divad ( Sinta / Corridor 2238), descended from carnivore/killer stock. Physically, the Brinn look like Terran crabs or spiders, but have ten limbs.

The six hindmost limbs are thicker and provide locomotion. Each ends in a set of strong grasping claws. While useless in combat, they provide excellent traction on rough terrain.

The leading four limbs are manipulatory. The first pair are slender and terminate in manipulatory hands, each of which is made up of four fingers and two thumbs. These are similar enough to human hands to permit the use of many pieces of human equipment without modification or unusual difficulty.

The second set of limbs is heavier and each end in a trio of sharp talons. These are the primary close combat weapons of the Brinn. The talons are quite sharp and the great strength of the arms makes them deadly.

A large bump (the dorsal sense cluster) rises from the centre of the back, and serves as the primary sense organ. Six eyes around it provide 360 degree vision. Brin eyesight is primarily in the infra-red but is limited in visual light. Also in the dorsal cluster is the Brinn repiratory system and sense of smell. The outer surface of the cluster contains a vibrational sensor. It is not sensitive in the air, but when placed against the ground, it picks up vibration through the ground. Brinn converse by settling on the ground and thrumming with their legs. A heated argument involves much stomping!



Brinn were contacted by the First Imperium and eagerly accepted membership into the Ziru Sirka. However, the Rule of Man established a military government to keep the natives under control. The mutual co-operation of the First Imperium was replaced by violence, ordered by military despots of the Second.

The Brinn broke free in the Long Night and managed to drive the humans from their system. Their campaign of expansion included bombarding human worlds with small asteroids and nuclear weapons. However, their ships had been claimed from the fallen Second Imperium, and the Brinn could not repair them. Neighbouring human cultures were able to drive the Brinn back into their home system.

The Pacification Campaigns forced the Brinn to join the Third Imperium. The Brinn were again under foreign domination. During the Civil War, they attempted to throw off their human masters via a rebellion. Subsequent Imperial counterstrikes decimated the Brinn fleet, and their system was recaptured. It was discovered that the Brinn had killed every human left on the planet when the Imperium withdrew.

The Brinn have been under military rule since the recapture of their system.

Clone

Biological copy of an existing being. A full-body clone is an "offspring" created from a single cell in the laboratory, rather than through the normal reproductive process. Such an offspring is a genetic duplicate of the single donor, and thus only has one parent. In all other respects, a full-body clone is identical to a normal offspring; the real oddity is the unnatural manner in which the offspring was conceived.

The clone is its own person, with its own mind just like any child of another. However, initially they have the minds of new-born children, and must be taught and educated just as any normal child.

The ability to create clones of higher life forms does not occur until tech level 10. Using growth quickening techniques an "adult" full-body clone can be grown in an artificial womb in about 2 years at that tech level. By tech level 13, growth time is down to 2 months.

Clones are often created of Imperial nobles. These are used as heirs until a natural heir is conceived. The polite term for these clones is true-son or true-daughter. For example, Seldrian Aledon is the true-daughter of Duke Norris Aledon of Regina ( Regina  / Spinward Marches 1920).

Humans and Hivers are the only major races to use clones to any degree. Aslan feel it is dishonourable, K'kree find such a "flesh-growing" technique distasteful, while Droyne and Vargr just don't bother.

Combat Armor

Combat Armor (artist Tim Bradstreet, used with permission of Tim Bradstreet and Marc Miller)Unpowered exoskeletal suit, surrounded by a carapace of multiple-layered synthetic armor. Inexpensive when compared to battle dress, combat armor provides comparable protection.

The TL 11 version dampens heat signature by the use of a "chill can" inserted into the cooling system, in the same manner as the combat environment suit . At TL 12, a chameleon option becomes available, as per battle dress. Most options available for battle dress are available for combat armor; for instance, integral communications equipment is common.

Combat armor is strictly military and not available on the open market; it is issued to high-tech troop units and elite mercenary battalions.

^^^^

Craft Type Codes

Every class of starship has a Craft Type Code assigned to them. This enables the Imperial authorities to identify and classify ships for various purposes. Examples of use include awarding various grades of spaceworthiness certificates, establishing taxation rules for different ship types, and the level of inspection required for a customs clearance.

Standard practice is to quote the primary function of the craft first, then any secondary modifier (optional). This means that when a craft is described in Anglic the codes appear reversed.

Examples of Craft Types Code usage are: Type S Scout; Type A2 Free Trader; Type CM Missile Cruiser, Type VF Fleet Carrier.

Note that certain combinations denote other types; for example, BB indicates a dreadnought.

Imperial Standard Credit Card

The Imperial Standard Credit Card (ISCC) is a portable bank teller. A micro-processor unit tracks the account, and contains information for personal identification. Made of plasteel, the card is nearly indestructible. It is nearly tamper-proof; most attempts merely blank the card and leave an identifiable trace. Identification information consists of a thumbprint actuator and a record of the owner's retina print. The latter is checked for verification on all transactions over Cr100,000.

Residents of systems of TL 13+ accept the card. In such systems, purchases are sped up through this card's use and take only a fraction of the time to do a quick retina scan in a credit register's sensor.

The Travellers' Aid Society accepts the use of the credit card in all of its facilities for cash advances or other services. It also offers, for a modest lifetime fee, a similar TAS services card.

Only millionaires can obtain the iridium edition of the card. It contains the owner's DNA code, allowing for positive identification and practically unlimited reliability of credit. Starships have been purchased on these cards!

Dating Systems
Unified Timeline

Three major dating systems are in use when referring to historical events within the Imperium - Terran, Vilani, and Imperial. Other races also have their own dating systems.

Terran dates centre on a year about midway through the period of Vilani ascendance. After that date, years ascend and are suffixed AD; before that date, years descend and are suffixed BC. There is no year zero. Terran years have 365 days and are considered a standard for length of year. Years are further subdivided into months and weeks, although these divisions have fallen into disuse outside the Solomani Sphere .

Vilani dates count from the year of the Establishment of the First Imperium (the Vilani Imperium). Those before are suffixed PI (Pre-Imperium); those after are suffixed VI (Vilani Imperium). There is no year zero. Vilani years are approximately 1.33 standard years in length (496 days). Vilani years are further subdivided into seasons, months, and weeks.

Imperial dates count from the year of the founding of the Third Imperium, specifying the year zero as a holiday year. Dates before that are negative; dates after that are positive, usually with the sign suppressed. Imperial dating uses a julian system for specifying days. Each day in the year is consecutively numbered beginning with 001. Thus, in the year 1105, the first day of the year is 001-1105. Weeks of seven days and months of 28 days are used to refer to lengths of time, but rarely to establish dates.

Zhodani dating is in olympiads (tleqazdijdiet). Each olympiad is of three Zhodani years; years are 0.75 standard years in length (273 days). An olympiad is used to mark the period from one set of Psionic Games to the next. Zhodani dates are given in olympiads, which are further subdivided into year, season, and day. The first olympiad corresponds to 2209 BC. The dating system itself has been in more or less continuous since then, with minor lapses due to war or temporary decline of ruling parties.

The Aslan calendar is based on the revolution of Kusyu ( Kilrai' / Dark Nebula 1919) around Tyeyo, its star. The Aslan year (ftahea) is about 320 standard days. A day (eakhau) is about 36 hours long. The same calendar is used on most Hierate worlds. There are no sub-divisions in the Aslan calendar; each day has its own unique name. The calendar takes as its starting point the first selection of the Tlaukhu as supreme council on Kusyu, about -2083 Imperial.

As in other things, the Vargr acknowledge no universal calendar. Individual planets impose years based on their own planet's movements; sometimes these standards are imposed across larger areas of space, but the is no true Vargr "standard year". Calendars date from whatever event the local populace cares to choose as a starting point. Imperial historians tend to assign dates in one of two forms, either according to the Imperial calendar, or based upon the Diaspora (Gvegh Vargr: gzokdae) or invention of interstellar travel by the Vargr in the year -3810. This latter is frequently used in giving dates to events in Vargr history.

Free Trader, Far Trader, Deep Trader, and Fat Trader (Subsidised Merchant)

Free Trader is the term given to an independent interstellar merchant ship, which plys the space lanes carrying cargo and passengers. Usually, a free trader is a 200-ton vessel capable of jump-1. The Craft Type Code assigned to these ships is A. An example of this type of ship is the standard 200-ton Beowulf-class free trader.

Far Trader is a variant designation of a free trader. A far trader has a higher jump capacity than a free trader; usually a jump-2 capability (twice that of normal). The Craft Type Code assigned to this type of ship is A2. A standard example of this type is the 200-ton Empress Marava-class far trader.

Deep Trader is another, rarer, variant of a free trader. Built for areas of low stellar density, deep traders are jump-3 capable. The Craft Type Code assigned to this class is A3. Since these ships are generally custom-built or produced in low quantities, no standard example exists.

Fat Trader is a disparaging term used to describe a Subsidised Merchant. This is a 400-ton merchant starship of ubiquitous design, generally run under the auspices of a world government (with a subsidy). Only capable of jump-1, the vessel has a much higher cargo capacity than its independent cousins. Even so, many independent merchants look on these ships with disdain, because they believe that receipt of the subsidy makes their captains and crew lazy. The Craft Type Code assigned to this class is R.

Denebian Spotted Fever

A mutated virus of high communicability and frequently devastating effects. The disease is transmitted by carriers who are themselves generally immune to it; they may suffer a slight illness after being exposed but recover quickly. The disease may then lie dormant for some time until triggered by environmental factors. These factors have not yet been identified with certainty, but would appear to be connected with life in artificial environments (shipboard living, asteroid or domed colony life).

Those who contract the disease will come down with it after 1-6 days. Symptoms include nausea, high fever, delirium, and an outbreak of dark red spots on the face, torso, hands and arms. The disease can rage for up to 12 days, depending on the level of attending medical expertise. Once a person has had the disease, however, he or she will be subject to recurrence every so often. Relapses last less than a week.

SuSAG has recently developed a pharmaceutical called GC96/B, specifically to combat Denebian Spotted Fever. This limits the initial fever to a period of three days or less. Doses must be kept refrigerated prior to use as temperatures above 50 degrees C cause the drug to break down rapidly into a worthless, inert substance.

Originally encountered on Deneb ( Usani / Deneb 1925), outbreaks of the virus have occurred throughout the Domain of Deneb .

Disintegrator Beam

Fictional weapon which causes total destruction of any matter which comes into contact with the beam.

Within the Imperium, research has been conducted to confirm whether it is possible to create a disintegrator beam weapon. Work has generally concentrated on modifying the defensive weapon known as a nuclear damper. Theory suggests that if the strong nuclear force between subatomic particles could be weakened, a target's atoms would fly apart.

To date, no successful "disintegrator beam" weapon has been created.

Diskhili Maneuver

A dangerous starship maneuver used to evade neutrino or EMS detection.

As popularised by Commander Diskhili during the Interstellar Wars, a ship enters a system at a great distance. Once the attacker is on the proper ballistic course, to the target, it shuts down its power plant, thus interrupting its neutrino emissions.

Since it takes time to power up the plant, and the onboard capacitors can only supply the weapons and screens for about 20 minutes in combat, the maneuver is risky. Nevertheless, the advantage of slipping past the first ring of defenders is so great that some captains will risk it.

A more standard use of this maneuver is simply to power down to a lower emission level. An enemy, detecting this low level, may underestimate the vessel's strength.

Dolphins

Intelligent minor race originating on Terra ( Sol / Solomani Rim 1827), raised to sentience by the Solomani corporation GenAssist during the Rule of Man.

A typical male Dolphin (Tursiops galactus) measures between 2.75 and 3.95m from the tip of its powerful flukes to its snout, and weighs about 100 to 150kg. Females tend to be smaller and lighter, on average. Their skin is smooth to the touch, and tends to be a purple-black along the dorsal surface, shading to white or light gray on the underside. Layers of fat make their hide equivalent to jack armour. Their eyes are located in the darker section of the face.

The brain of a Dolphin is 1.5 times the size of a human, although this should not be taken as a sign of greater (or lesser) intelligence. For the most part, this difference is due to the greater mass of the Dolphin body. The original dolphin lifespan was about 20 years, but the enhanced Dolphins typically live 50 to 60 years. Anagathics are available, with prices, benefits and risks similar to those used by humans.

The main Dolphin sense centres on their very accurate echo-location system. Geneering has improved this to give a 100m range. Dolphin hearing is able to detect sounds ranging in pitch from 150 to 150,000 Hertz (by contrast, Terran cats can hear sounds up to 50,000 Hz, bats to 75,000 Hz, and humans only up to 20,000 Hz). Underwater eyesight is fairly keen, as it has been adapted for that environment. The lenses of their eyes are very globular and hence convex in nature in order to reverse the negative effects of aquatic reflection. However, this makes the Dolphin very near-sighted when out of the water. To counter this, many Dolphins wear corrective lenses when not in a Travel Suit (which has a special visor built-in).

The diet of Dolphins, like their semi-sentient ancestors, is wholly carniverous. Modern Dolphins do take great joy in sampling new foods and tastes. A Dolphin requires 110 calories per kg per day to sustain itself. This is far greater than the human need of 50 calories per kg per day. This translates to roughly 10% of body mass, per day.

Typical members of Tursiops galactus can dive for up to 15 minutes without respirator assistance. In practice, many wear tanked air supplies to allow a greater endurance for underwater operations. When swimming near the surface, Dolphins breathe 2 to 6 times per minute, increasing up to 8 after a long dive or period of exertion. Unlike humans, who normally use only 12.5% of their lung capacity, Dolphins almost completely empty and fill their lungs with every breath. Also, they store much more oxygen in their blood and muscle tissues than humans, which allows them to make such prolonged dives.

A single glance at the Dolphin body is enough to reveal the perfection of their streamlining. Nowhere in explored space is there a creature so perfectly evolved in a hydro-dynamic sense. As a rule of thumb, Dolphins can maintain 40 kph when swimming and can attain burst speeds of up to 60 kph.

Although normal swimming depth is above 30m, Dolphins can dive up to 200m in extreme cases (humans can only manage 125m unprotected). Furthermore, the physiology of a Dolphin is such that they are wholly immune to caisson disease ("the bends") which is a constant hazard to human divers.

The natural evolution of cetaceans on Terra is still something of a mystery, even to sciences of the 57th century (Terran dating). However, their "uplifting" to sentient status is well documented. The Solomani corporation GenAssist , established to adapt Terran native lifeforms to alien climates, saw a need for creatures that could assist in colonising and developing worlds with high hydrographic percentages. To that end, GenAssist began research on dolphins during the Rule of Man . As other species were dropped from GenAssist 's overall project, the dolphins had the full attention of the company trained on them, and rapidly attained true intelligence. In -1988, just prior to the collapse of the Rule of Man , a handful of Dolphin colonies were seeded along the rimward frontiers of what is now the Solomani Sphere .

In the centuries since, the Dolphins have proved themselves to be fantastically adaptive and very loyal to the Solomani government. The reason for their loyalty has very little to do with political philosophies, as Dolphin psychology is radically different from their human patrons. Rather, each and every Dolphin is acutely aware that the Solomani gave them the gift of sentience, and they feel indebted to the Terrans for this. The Solomani have not discouraged this way of thinking; in fact, they have fostered it.

Dolphin culture is based on a belief in total equality. Everything is shared equally and each citizen is entitled to the full benefits of the society's capabilities. They are unable to understand many concepts which seem almost absolute to humans; for example, the ideas of property and land ownership. If one Dolphin has a tool that another needs, the latter simply takes the tool and returns it after use (is is customary to ask if the current holder has finished with the object first, but this is not unlike a human request to "borrow" an item). Further, the concept of land ownership is beyond them. They point out that "the sea is always in motion, so how can you claim a portion of it as yours?" In the same way, the land is in motion (although far more slowly), and similar reasoning results.

These concepts can result in problems when Dolphins interact with other lifeforms. On starships, for instance, Dolphin passengers have been known to take objects (such as jewelry) which appealed to them, without asking permission if the object did not seem to be currently in use. If confronted with the "theft", they gladly admit to it and cheerfully return the object as long as they have finished "using" it. Dolphins who have spent a great deal of time among other races eventually learn that this is considered improper behaviour by many others. At this point, they usually modify their behaviour and ask to use things which others seem attached to. In such cases, they see this as a game they must play in order to "fit in".

Dolphins do not usually gather in large communities, but live in extended family groups of between 15 and 20 individuals. Family groups interact frequently, and it is not uncommon for two or more of them to dwell very near to one another. They simply do not have a structural society such as envisioned by humans and others. In most cases, colony worlds composed primarily of Dolphin settlers are classified by the Scouts as government code 0 (anarchy).

The actual number of individual Dolphins varies widely from world to world. On Terra, the original dolphins are extinct (they still thrive on a few other worlds, though) and the latest census counted about 2.5 million Dolphins.

While Dolphins are well-adapted for aquatic environments, they are handicapped when removed from them. In order to overcome such difficulties, science has come up with a number of devices which make life much more pleasant for Dolphins who must function out of the water.

The first and by far the most important of these is the Travel Suit (or TeeSuit). This is the Dolphin equivalent to a vacc suit, and contains a super-humid environment. A grav "belt" and an in-built commo system allows a Dolphin to move around and communicate when out of the water.

The second device is the waldo. A serious handicap which Dolphins suffer is their lack of manipulatory appendages. This is unheard of in naturally occurring sophont species, but is not uncommon among the Solomani's "uplifted races". To overcome this problem, human scientists created mechanical manipulatory devices known as waldos. Waldos act as artificial "arms", which permit a dolphin to handle objects almost as well as humans. At TL 12, neural control plugs are available to be surgically implanted into the skull of a Dolphin. Waldos can then be plugged in, allowing them to be directed by nerve impulses.

Finally, Dolphin starships have certain modifications specifically tailored to their occupants. The most instantly obvious change is that such craft maintain a zero-gravity field aboard them at all times (even while grounded) so that the crew can move freely about without TeeSuits. The atmosphere is a standard oxygen-nitrogen composition, but is very humid. This maintains normal moisture levels for the crew without having to keep compartments flooded. The ship is controlled by waldos or direct cybernetic links, as described above.

Donosev-class Survey Scout

Donosev-class Survey Scout, with detached cutter, in asteroid belt (artist Jesse DeGraff, used with permission);  Imperial Interstellar Scout Service design created specifically to resurvey the interior regions of the Imperium, updating maps and charts, and maintaining beacons and markers for astrogation hazards.

The ship is catagorised as Type SZ, or "Scout Experimental", and in fact three different versions of this ship have been built. The most recent, described here, was the result of improvements to sensor placement made during the Second Survey .

As is the case with most modern Scout vessels, the Donosev-class is not equipped for use in hostile areas.

The class is named after Master Chief Surveyor Villemina Donosev. Individual ships are named for famous scouts in the Imperial service.

Dreadnought

A dreadnought is a superbattleship, designed to be the best possible battleship. The Imperial Navy places the dreadnought class designation on its latest, most effective battleships, redesignating them simply as battleships when their superior abilities are supplanted by newer construction.

The concept of a dreadnought does not mean that battleships are not built as well. Due to the expense of dreadnoughts, the Imperial Navy also acquires battleships.

^^^^

L-Hyd Tanks ( Drop Tanks )

Disposable liquid hydrogen fuel tanks used by starships to increase their fuel load. These tanks are fitted to the outside of a starship, and drop away before jump. The result is more interior space available for cargo and passengers.

Such "drop tanks" must be replaced each time they are used, so they are practical only on runs to civilised areas, or to increase fuel capacity to allow several jumps.

L-Hyd tanks are installed outside the hull, and increase the total tonnage of the ship; this reduces the efficiency of the jump drives. With tanks retained, efficiency is decreased, and jump capability is reduced; when the tanks drop away, tonnage is reduced, the drive efficiency is increased, and jump capacity increases. Drop tanks can create radical changes in ship performance.

Jump Troops
Drop Troops

Specially trained units assigned to planetary invasions. Jump troops (also known as drop troops) are inserted into planetary atmospheres from orbit, free-falling to the ground in individual re-entry drop capsules.

Speed and shock are the best weapons of jump troops. Their sudden arrival only a minute after they appear as a meteor shower in the sky can cause surprise and chaos in even the best of opposing units. Jump troops are usually used to secure landing zones before the main invasion forces arrive. The LZ can be a starport or just a patch of open ground, but the task of the jump troop force is to secure the perimeter and wait for reinforcements.

The other main use for jump troops is in commando raids on specific objectives; for example, fire control sensors for a deep meson gun site, or economic targets such as a starport or power station. Once the mission is over, the troops are quickly extracted by assault shuttle .

Jump troops are relatively lightly-armed infantry, generally equipped with battle dress and whatever support weapons can be man-carried. They need quick reinforcement by regular line units, heavy weapons and armour before thay are overwhelmed by counter-attacks. Note that all Imperial Marines are drop-trained, along with specialised units of the Imperial Army.

Four types of drop capsule are available: basic drop capsules, combat assault capsules, advanced combat assault capsules, and decoy capsules.

Duchy of Oasis

The Duchy of Oasis is an alliance of worlds dating back to the obscure times of the Long Night . It includes 44 worlds of Oasis and Wolf subsectors within Zarushagar sector.

When the expanding Third Imperium came upon the Duchy, these worlds were reluctant to join the new empire. They believed that their worlds did not need any outside help. After much economic and political pressure, Cleon 's ambassadors finally managed to coax the worlds of the Duchy to become Imperial member worlds.

Many worlds of the old Duchy were never completely happy with Imperial rule, and during the Ilelish Rebellion in the 400's, the Duchy tried to declare its independence once again. Emperor Martin III swiftly brought massive Imperial forces to bear, and the worlds reluctantly backed down. They had little choice in the matter, since their only other option was possible widespread destruction of their systems. His bloodless victory secure, Martin III also ordered the Oasis subsector capital moved to Megalmatree ( Oasis / Zarushagar 2826), and Oasis ( Oasis / Zarushagar 3130) was stripped of all political power at the Imperial level.

Dust Spice

Rare euphoric spice used for seasoning food, especially fruit. Harvested from the bark of desert scrub plants, this seasoning is popular with humans as a mild recreational spice with effects slighter than, but similar to, that of alcohol.

Certain non-human races (notably Aslan and Vargr) find dust-spice a much more powerful euphoric, and it is in constant demand by those races.

Dust-spice can be sold for Cr12,000 to Cr22,000 per kilogram on a number of worlds within the Spinward Marches.

Dynchia

Intelligent minor race of humaniti, native to Melantris ( Yuddunn / Leonidae 0603). Dynchia are about 2.2m in height and weigh about 100 kg. They are slender and long-limbed. Skin tones range from pale to bronze-tan; hair colour is usually brown or black, but snowy white hair is not uncommon. The Dynchia have six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot. Their teeth actually consist of two bony "jaws" (as if their teeth had been fused into one upper and one lower "jaw") with fang-like extrusions. These physical differences appear to have been geneered by the Ancients.

As well as the physical divergence, two elements of human psychology (to protect females from danger, and to possess land) appear to have been left out of or modified in the Dynchia. Firstly, the Dynchia have absolute equality of the sexes; prejudice against or protection of one sex is psychologically impossible. Secondly, a Dynchia is not a citizen of a particular world; he is a member of a clan, which in turn is a member of a tribe. A tribe may rule anywhere, as territory is not important.

The Dynchia have a rare and unusual quality: they are warrior individualists in an un-warlike culture. That is, they never make war upon their own race, although fights, duels, and challenges are common, as is a warrior ethic. Their culture is completely independant of territory. The social basis of Dynchia mentality is a deep sense of honour, both personal and as part of their clan or tribe. The general religion of the Dynchia is reverence for ancestors and worship of tribal heroes. To be false to one's honour is to forfeit a chance to become a revered ancestor.

At coming-of-age, all individuals go through an extensive series of trials, to determine their right to the status of adulthood. Seven percent fail - and die. Thus, all adults are skilled warriors. The military are merely the cream of the crop, specialising in combat arts. For this reason, it is generally considered impossible to conquer a Dynchia world.

Dynchia government is based on councils, each consisting of the top ranking members of each tribe present. The highest of these councils is the Council of the Twelve , which rules all of the Comitia , and speaks for all the tribes. The highest ranking clan of each tribe is the Prince of that tribe, and sits on the Council . The military is subject only to the Council of the Twelve , and exempt from responsibility to clan or tribe.

The Dynchia have a low tech level (TL 12) but are not hampered by this. Not only is it higher than most TL's in the region, but the Dynchia have an added advantage - they have refined their designs for maximum efficiency. They may not have fusion guns, but they have the best laser rifles in all of known space, and the same applies of the rest of their industry.

A low rate of population expansion gives them time to fully develop a world before they are forced to expand by population pressure. As an example of the degree of perfection Dynchia designers have achieved, it may be mentioned that their homeworld, Melantris ( Yuddunn / Leonidae 0603) has a population of over 4 billion, but has no pollution problems. Their architecture is famous for its beauty and perfection.

Sphereworld
Dyson Sphere

Using incredibly strong materials similar to those in a ringworld, and adding gravity generators where necessary for strength and comfort, a spherical shell could be built to completely enclose a star.

Such a shell would then trap all stellar radiation for use by the civilization. With a radius of 149 million kilometers (about 93 million miles), the internal surface area would equal about one billion Earths.

First posulated by Terran scientist Freeman Dyson prior to contact with the Vilani, no extant examples of a sphereworld are known to exist.

Also see planetoid, rosette, ringworld.

Dzofakael

A manufacturer in the Vargr Extents, well known for its sturdy heavy equipment and ship armaments. Among its heavy equipment products are bulldozers, backhoes, tractors, and small fusion-powered locomotives. Their other products are heavy lasers, PGMP-13s , sandcasters, and ship hull armor.

In the Imperium, Dzofakael would be classified as an interface company , as it crosses so many Vargr borders. Among the Vargr, this is considered normal, and Dzofakael is considered to be a sector-wide company .

Earleatrais

"Referee" or "judge" (from the Trokh language). A male Aslan appointed from a neutral clan to provide impartial rulings.

In the Aslan Hierate, crimes with victims are resolved by the appointing of an earleatrais, who considers all of the available evidence and makes his rulings accordingly.

Ritual duelling also employs an earleatrais in order to ensure that the Ktyuikeasiyyorl ("The Words Under Which We Die") is followed to the letter. The is the "code duello" of the Aslan, and sets out all aspects of the ensuing combat.

The most honourable role of an earleatrais is to oversee a ritual clan war between other clans. The appointment of an earleatrais always brings great honour to the clan to which he belongs. Even more honour can be gained if the earleatrais renders a decision which is not only fair, but allows each side in the dispute to walk away with as much pride and honour as possible.

Eldorado

Name of the Imperial strike cruiser which made first contact with the Islands Clusters in the centre of the Great Rift.

The Eldorado misjumped into the center of the Great Rift in 986, near the end of the Third Frontier War. The crew was surprised to discover two subsectors inhabited by Terrans using sleeper ships . The Eldorado eventually returned to the Imperium with the news. The IISS has worked with the individual worlds since then.

Energy Weapons

Any one of a number of weapons which fire a highly energized beam of ionized gas at their targets, causing damage by their intense heat and kinetic energy. Hydrogen fuel is heated to a plasma state by a powerful laser ignition system, then released through a magnetically focussed field along the weapon's barrel.

The class can be further subdivided into plasma and fusion guns. Fusion guns contain the plasma slightly longer until a fusion reaction begins to take place. The extra firepower this produces makes the fusion gun the more powerful weapon in this class.

Energy weapons range in size from man-portable models, through battlefield weapons mounted on tanks, to starship turret weapons for use in deep space. The largest are contained in large batteries known as bays .

^^^^

Escorts

Small starships of up to 20,000 tons intended to be light support craft for larger ships, primarily cruisers. Escorts are also widely used for convoy protection and commerce raiding roles.

Close escorts (CE) are very small starships intended for anti-piracy operations in organised squadrons. An example is the Gazelle-class Close Escort.

Destroyer escorts (DE) are the first type capable of accompanying a regular Imperial fleet. They are also used for convoy protection, orbital patrols, police operations, garrison duties, and even limited strike missions. An example is the Chrysanthenum-class Destroyer Escort .

Fleet escorts (FE) are the largest of the escorts. They are primarily designed to accompany Imperial fleets. However, some classes have often been sent on independent missions - gunboat diplomacy, showing the flag, orbital support of ground operations, transport of diplomats or refugees, fleet courier operations, and even flagship duty for some smaller squadrons. An example is the P. F. Sloan-class Fleet Escort .

Eskayloyt

"Lost Home" (from the Droyne language, Oynprith).

Droyne name for the lost Droyne homeworld. The location of the world is believed to have been in the Spinward Marches, Deneb, or Trojan Reach sectors. This is due to the large number of Droyne worlds and Ancients sites.

Casual observers call the world Droynia. The proper name, Eskayloyt, appears independently in myths on three scattered Droyne worlds: Andor ( Five Sisters / Spinward Marches 0236), Zeen (?????/????? 99999), and Auitawry ( Binary / Trojan Reach 3140). The name is accepted by the majority of scientists researching Droyne origins.

Characteristics of the homeworld are difficult to determine, but some have been predicted by an analysis of the Droyne themselves. Eskayloyt was a small world with a standard or dense atmosphere, plus a significant hydrosphere. The range of statistics most frequently given are Size 3 to 6, Atmosphere 6 or 8 (probably 8), and Hydrosphere 3+. The flying ability of the Droyne relies on a fairly weak gravity and a reasonably high pressure; a hydrosphere is required for the development of life.

The data and assumptions about Eskayloyt have led to many theories about its location and fate. No known world provides the fossil evidence that it was Eskayloyt; active searches and excavations are underway on several worlds that show promise. Some scholars have proposed that the homeworld was destroyed in the Final War.

Hiroshi Estigarribia 

Founder of the Rule of Man.

After the Terrans had defeated the Vilani Imperium, they moved quickly to occupy the territory of the former empire. Terra voted to rule the Vilani worlds directly, as part of the Terran Confederation. The colonies resented this, believing that their autonomy would dissappear.

Admiral Hiroshi Estigarribia, commander-in-chief of the Confederation Navy , was sympathetic to this viewpoint. He also realised that the Confederation government could not possibly control the vast Vilani colonies. Accordingly, he proclaimed himself Regent of the Vilani Imperium and Protector of Terra, uniting both human states under the Rule of Man in -2204 (2314 AD). When he addressed the new empire, he used the term "Solomani" for the first time.

Upon Hiroshi's death, his chief-of-staff crowned himself Emperor Hiroshi II (retrospectively naming the Admiral as Emperor Hiroshi I).

Ethueng

Major Vargr pirate organisation.

Anticipating that the Kforuzeng would disband, Tukera Lines encouraged a major group to split off in 1115, and transferred its dealings for protection to them.

The relationship between Ethueng and Tukera is remarkably close. The Ethueng prey on other Imperial traders in Vargr space competing with Tukera, particularly Oberlindes Lines.

Ramscoop Jumpship
Exatar Project

A ramscoop jumpship is designed to gather interstellar hydrogen before and after a jump. In theory, if such a ship could operate efficiently, it would never need to refuel at a gas giant or starport and would have essentially limitless range. The ship's disadvantage is that it takes many weeks of constant acceleration on maneuver drives to gather enough hydrogen for a jump.

The best-known example is the experimental craft Exatar, designed in -248 by the Interstellar Confederacy (a rival to the Sylean Federation ). It was moderately successful in tests in and around Confederacy space, and two more ships, the Macnamara and Esdyla were started in -241. Unfortunately, the building yards on the moon of of Sketola ( Bunkeria / Core 0622) were captured during the first stages of the Civil War of the Interstellar Confederacy , and the rebels destroyed the two new ships in their yards. The Exatar was captured intact by the rebels and used as a spyship throughout the conflict; it was decommissioned shortly after the war ended.

Exile Camp

A location committed to the containment of individuals guilty (or presumed guilty) of political crimes of discontent. Government controls are usually restricted to the retention of the inmate, and a general oppression of the population.

Federation of Arden

Independent, human-inhabited federation located in the demilitarised neutral area between the Zhodani Consulate and the Imperium.

Arden ( Vilis / Spinward Marches 1011) was absorbed by the expanding Imperium in 290. However, it was made independent as part of the armistice of 986 which ended the Third Frontier War. Recently, Arden became imperialist, expanding its dominion by absorbing Zircon ( Jewell / Spinward Marches 1110) and Utoland ( Jewell / Spinward Marches 1209).

As a small and relatively weak government, the Federation has chosen neutrality as its course toward self-preservation. This neutrality is of a passive nature; its systems have been declared conditionally open; any belligerent may enter any of the systems for replenishment and refuelling. Arden 's own defence fleet stands ready to defend the system and segregate ships of the belligerents into designated areas of the systems. Arden 's neutrality has made the Federation a clandestine meeting place for agents of all sides - for intelligence gathering and negotiation.

The Federation is controlled by the Arden Society , a small group of dedicated individuals who become members through contributions of finance or labour. The government is extremely repressive.

Fledgling Lines

The beginners at interstellar trade and transport are the fledgling lines. Some are free traders who have been diligent enough (or lucky enough) to make some money, and that money has been invested in additional ships. Others are veterans of the larger lines, now gone into business for themselves. Still others are partnerships, usually of several independent ship owners who have banded together to create a merchant line. A few are just businessmen, lucky enough to be awarded a merchant subsidy, and are now trying to make it turn a profit.

Nine out of ten fledgling lines fail within the first five years. Of those remaining, nine out of ten barely break even. That one of a hundred remaining, however, eventually moves up to a higher standard - perhaps as an interface line, perhaps as a subsector-wide line. Fledgling lines are the most common lines, the most risky, and have the greatest potential, however slim the chance of achievement.

An example of a fledgling line is UTP.

Flicking

Psionic investigators have blended psionics and technology to produce psionically sensitive switches which can sense very basic psionic activity. They can be tripped by anyone (psionically trained) who has learned the technique called flicking. Switches are elementary on-off devices which respond to a command by shifting from state to the other. They can be used to operate light or communicator switches, or other devices.

Psionic switches are illegal in the Imperium. Most Zhodani ships are equipped with such as components of iris valves, automatic doors, and many lights, temperature, or environment controls, and entertainment or communication devices.

Florian League

League of worlds situated in the Trojan Reach and Beyond sectors. The Floriani began to expand from their homeworld Floria ( Yggdrasil / Trojan Reach 0213) in -170. Contact with the Imperium followed in 185. The Florian League itself was formed in 506. The League is governed by a hierarchy of councils, where councillors are chosen from among the Barnai populace by lottery.

Forboldn Project

The primary colonisation project within the Regina subsector. Originally conceived in 987 to utilise the resources of Forboldn ( Regina / Spinward Marches 1808), the project began its execution phase in 1089, shortly after the Fourth Frontier War. Large numbers of colonists were recruited and shipped in cold sleep from the Imperial core, with arrival times set from 1110 to 1120. Simultaneously preparations on Forboldn began, with detailed planetary surveys to pinpoint resources and initial building projects to prepare industry and quarters for the arrival of colonists.

An interesting aspect of such colonisation projects is the recruitment method used to supply the personnel who will actually make the colony function. Since virtually no amount of money will entice an individual to leave their home and livlihood for the bleak desolation of a colony world, the Ministry of Colonisation has established several programs to produce colonists. Most obvious is the colonise in lieu of prison term program. However, several other programs have also shown signs of success. In the unemployment insurance program, High Population worlds have successfully used the colonisation project as a means of reducing unemployment over the long term. In a similar medical insurance program, indigenes unable to obtain medical treatment are provided with their needs in exchange for signing on to a colony.

The needs of a colony for skills are met through the anagathics program; qualified (and aged) individuals can be provided with anagathics to extend their life spans in return for their providing such skills as administration, mechanical crafts, or medical expertise. Finally land grants to retiring veterans has provided a cadre for the new colony's military and police forces.

There have been reports that the colonisation project is lagging behind, and that the arrival of the colonists will be delayed by at least 10 years. The delay appears to be due to the social and civil unrest at the coreward end of the Regina subsector.

Peace of Ftahair

Treaty which ended the Aslan Border Wars (-1118 to 380) and created a 30-parsec-wide buffer zone between the Aslan Hierate and the Third Imperium.

This zone indirectly fostered the growth of many smaller interstellar governments and resulted in many independent systems within Reaver's Deep.

Fueznuzorg

A special organization within the Kforuzeng.

This most feared group is seldom involved with piracy and raiding. Instead, the Fueznuzorg's primary purpose is seeking vengeance against the corsair groups that abandoned the Kforuzeng, particularly the Ethueng. It also serves as an internal policing organization within the Kforuzeng.

Full Imperium Party

This offshoot of the One Imperium Movement believes that all humans should be brought under one interstellar government.

Where the One Imperium Movement wants to annex the Julian Protectorate and the Solomani Confederation , this group goes further. Because the Zhodani are humans, they should also be conquered and forced to live like "decent people."

In 1098, the Imperium prosecuted several high ranking members of the Full Imperium Party for the high justice crimes of bribing Imperial officials in the Spinward Marches sector and the attempted theft of a 500,000-ton naval dreadnought.

G-Carrier

TL 12 Resolve-class G-Carrier; An enclosed, armored military or paramilitary grav vehicle, intended for troop carrier duties. With performance similar to that of an air/raft, the G-carrier generally has a gun mount and a rear hatch door. It requires a crew of one driver (with air/raft skill), plus a gunner for the weapon, if any. It can carry 14 persons in total, plus two tons of cargo (or 250 kg of cargo for each person not carried). Thus driver, gunner and 5 tons of cargo is its maximum capacity.

Various examples include the Resolve (TL 12), Lopec (TL 15) and Kankurur (TL 15) classes of G-Carriers.

GSbAG
(Geschichtkries Sternschiffbau AG)

Founded, according to company propaganda, in -2438 from a consortium of old Terran manufacturing firms. In actual fact, there is no concrete evidence of the corporation's existance prior to a contract with the Sylean Federation Navy in -334. Unlike other manufacturers, GSbAG (populary known as Gas-bag) has restricted itself almost exclusively to the manufacture of starships since its earliest known existance.

Gazelle-class Close Escort

Gazelle-class Close EscortAn Imperial Navy standard class built by the hundreds, and a common component of Navy task forces in the Spinward Marches.

Designed specifically to protect the line-of-battle against enemy skirmish forces and for general escort duty, the class is well-armed for its size and type.

L-Hyd fuel tanks may be dropped in extreme circumstances, allowing jump-5. The tanks must be replaced unless a severe reduction in jump ability is to be tolerated.

Geonee Cultural Region

An area within the Massilia sector, made up of eight worlds populated by the Geonee. The Geonee are a minor race of humaniti, native to Shiwonee ( Shiwonee / Massilia 1430).

The Geonee Cultural Region is rich in Ancient artifacts. The Imperium has verified that artifacts have been recovered from Lagna ( Shiwonee / Massilia 1029) and Shiwonee ( Shiwonee / Massilia 1430); the Geonee themselves claim that all eight of their worlds were originally inhabited by the "Geonee"; that is, the Ancients.

One interesting point is that all eight systems contain extensive asteroid belts. The Geonee claim that these are the remnants of worlds destroyed in the Final War, but most Imperial scientists dispute this, while admitting that the frequency of belts is, statistically speaking, unusually high.

The Shiwonee system has three asteroid belts; Shiwonee itself is quite active, seismically, with quakes being common and 44 active volcanoes dotting the globe.

Gerontocracy of Ormine

Small interstellar government primarily found in the Akhlare subsector of the Dark Nebula sector. The citizens consist mainly of Ormine, with a small scattering of Solomani humans.

Although nearer to the Aslan Hierate than the Solomani, historical reasons mean that the Gerontocracy is part of the Solomani political sphere.

Gl'lu

Intelligent minor race native to Kubishush ( Inar / Deneb 0917). Their planet circles at the outer edge of their star's habitable zone, giving them average temperatures of -40 degrees C. A dense nitrogen atmosphere hides ammonia seas and geologically active terrain.

The Gl'lu are a hermaphroditic species sporting four arms and three legs on their stout bodies. Crowning their heads are three eye stalks. Oxidation of the ammonia in the air drives their metabolism.

Highleaf

One of the most potent drugs known to man, worth up to Cr25,000 per kilogram in the Imperium. It is extremely addictive, and can be quite dangerous to humans if used too often or if properly processed. To K'kree, !xug'k is a mildly narcotic agricultural product almost as stimulating as a glass of wine is to a human. In K'kree space, highleaf is worth about Cr25 per kilogram.

Hkahaoseahe

Legendary clan of ancient Aslan tradition, often claimed as ancestors by various distinguished clans of contemporary Aslan society. The exploits of the Hkahaoseahe are recorded in the cycle of epics traditionally grouped together under the title of Siyreakhaotoior. These epic poems and stories are among the oldest and best-known of Aslan literature.

Hlanssai

Intelligent minor race descended from intermittent/gatherer stock native to the world Vrirhlanz (unplaced, Vargr Extents). Humanoid in shape, the Hlanssai average 2.1m tall, but are only 55 to 60kg in weight, making them tall and slender. Their bodies are 50% fur-covered; their most striking visual feature is their head, with its two large eyes and two even larger ears.

Hlanssai intelligence was the product of the need to analyse and comprehend the sensory data gathered through their acute senses. As a result, their psychology is oriented towards immediate sensual awareness. Their philosophy is generally sensualistic, frequently dismissive of the long term, and notoriously sybaritic and hedonistic. Response is given to a situation, with no thought as to the long-term consequences - and often, therefore, dramatically.

Beyond the Vargr Extents, the Hlanssai are widely seen as enigmatic, unstable, intelligent and interesting; Hlanssai attitudes toward other races vary, but generally involve curiosity mixed with ironic humour.

Holiday Year
Year 0

The year zero in the history of the Third Imperium, established by Cleon I to commemorate the establishment of the Imperium.

Technically an aspect of calendar reform, the use of the year zero provides a central date point for counting years back into the Long Night and forward into the future of the Imperium.

The actual advantages of a holiday year are slight; centuries begin in the hundredth numbered year instead of the first numbered year, and the number of years between any two dates can be determined by subtraction.

More importantly at the time, the holiday year was used as part of the public relations campaigns which were impressing the authority of the Imperium upon local governments. The minor requirement of changing to the new calendar was used to determine co-operation by those governments.

The IASM is the training-ground for most of the top Imperial scientists, medical practioners, researchers. Founded in 341 by Imperial decree, by 950, branch campuses had spread to 31 worlds throughout the Imperium. The Academy is known and respected beyond the Imperium's borders, and researchers affiliated with the Academy are received with all the pomp usually reserved for visiting dignitaries.

The Academy was the chief instigator in the creation of the Imperial Science Union, a major research organisation.

The Academy contains 4 colleges: the College of Medicine, the College of Physical Sciences, the College of Social Sciences, and the College of Engineering. Graduates obtain a doctorate, may be accepted as a member of the Imperial Science Union, and may even be granted one of the Union's lab ships .

Imperial Interstellar Scout Service

The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service (IISS) is the exploratory arm of the Imperium.

It has its origins in the initial explorations of the Imperium's frontiers. Long ago, however, the Scout Service expanded its responsibilities to cover more than mere exploration. It now maps the territory it once explored, and it is responsible for providing navigational charts and maps to the ships that now travel through that territory. In addition, the Scout Service provides long distance courier or postal services between points within the empire.

Ilraiki

Intelligent minor race native to Gasha ( Arar / Massilia 1508). The race is being studied by the Yamashi Research Institute . The Institute colonised Gasha in 453 to study the Ilraiki race and its evolutionary adaptation to this planet as it grew colder. The climatic change was caused by an increase in its orbital diameter due to the near passage of another star.

Imperial Marines

Imperial Marine SunburstMembers of the armed fighting forces normally assigned to squadrons or fleets to give them a military reaction capability. Originally formed as an adjunct to naval forces, marines have developed into a full-fledged military force in their own right. Within the Imperium, this force is known as the Imperial Marines.

The Imperial Marines provide a hard-hitting, rapidly deployable strike force for offensive and defensive military operations. They deal with piracy and boarding actions in space, defend the starports and bases belonging to the Imperial Navy, and supplement other ground forces such as the local or Imperial Army.

In many places along the frontier, the Imperial Marines also serve as an interstellar police force, keeping the peace and enforcing the Imperial Rules of War. This last function has led to them being known by mercenaries as "the cops".

Imperial Starport Authority

The Imperial Starport Authority (SPA) is the organization responsible for all port operations (ground and orbital), and maintains the security of the extrality line surrounding every Imperial port. The only exceptions are class E and X starports, which have no SPA facilities at all.

The bureaucracy of the early Third Imperium realized that it would have to take on the responsibility of maintaining the quality of commercial ports. The Bases Division of the IISS) created the Civilian Starports Office to establish standards for taking over existing ports, formalize procedures for building new ones, and prioritize new construction and upgrade needs.

In 422, after the completion of the First Survey, a decree of Emperor Martin III separated this office from the Scouts and established it as the Imperial Starport Authority. It is part of the Imperial Ministry of Commerce, though its chief executive answers directly to the Emperor.

The Starport Authority emblem can be found on all official SPA stationery, buildings, vehicles, and uniforms. The emblem consists of a large terrestrial world on which is placed the cartographic symbol for a starport: a device resembling crosshairs made up of a circle and a pair of crossed lines. Encircling the planet is a stylized starship with a thruster trail to indicate that it is launching. The emblem has been in continuous use since the SPA was founded.

Imperial Stationery

The Imperial Family has reserved (both by custom and by law) a distinctive design for its personal stationery. Well-known throughout the Imperium through its use for routine messages and for Imperial appointments, this writing material is cream-coloured artificial vellum, embossed with the Imperial Sunburst in gold.

Because it is used for Imperial appointments (even when issued in blank for offices in the Marches) all Imperial officials are familiar with the design and can readily tell normal physical forgeries from the real thing.

Electronic versions of the stationery also exist. These are data-encrypted with a special code lock and require a special hardware key to be unlocked. Some are even matched to the recipient's DNA, coded in when the stationery was used, thus making even electronic forgeries difficult.

Imperial megacorporation.

Instellarms is a specialty supplier of all sizes and types of mercenary units. It manufactures, buys, and sells military equipment. Agents of the firm can often be found on a battlefield, negotiating the purchase of the equipment of the losing side before the battle is completely over. The company does not deal in interstellar vessels, or in chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons.

Instellarms was founded in 626, shortly after the end of the Civil War, by Axel Murdoch, a retired mercenary colonel. Taking advantage of inside contacts in the Imperial military, Murdoch was able to obtain large quantities of surplus military equipment at very low prices - but which still cost billions of credits. Where he got his financing is unknown.

Murdoch's connections with various mercenary unit commanders, coupled with a willingness to ignore the Imperial Rules of War and other regulations on mercenary warfare (when the profits were large enough), gave Instellarms a decisive edge over its competition. Instellarms grew to dominate the mercenary arms trade in the Imperium's coreward sectors within 90 years, and in the whole Imperium within two centuries.

Interface Lines

Where one territory ends and another begins, the special interface line meets the needs of the marketplace. Interface lines provide passenger and freight service across the border. They carefully maintain favor with both sides of the border, and sell as part of their product easy transit over the line.

The Vargr Extents are full of interface lines serving the many distinct Vargr territories. Interface lines operate along the Imperial border with the Aslan, they serve the interface with the K'kree, they even serve along the borders with the Solomani and the Zhodani.

Interface lines may serve routes either long or short. Some merely reach from a major world on one side of the border to a similar major world on the other side. Others (trading with the K'kree, for example) may operate a trade route as long as 75 or 100 parsecs in order to transport goods from one territory to another.

Examples of interface lines include Oberlindes Lines and Tyeyo Fteahrao Yolr.

Ishimaga Genealogical Society

Rather than a society dedicated to researching geneology, the Ishimaga Genealogical Society (IGS) is dedicated to retaining Vilani racial purity. Members of this group are proud of the high percentage of Vilani blood flowing through their veins. Potential members are carefully screened, both genealogically and biologically, to ensure that they qualify by their racial purity.

The IGS was formed sometime during the Long Night , but its early history is not too well known. Offices of the IGS can be found throughout the Imperium, with headquarters at Ishimaga in the Lishun sector.

Iystyos

An inexpensive intoxicant popular with Aslan spaceship crews. The grain from which it is brewed is native to Kusyu ( Kilrai' / Dark Nebula 1919) and has been exported to almost every Aslan world where it could be grown. The brew often causes hallucinations in humans who are unwary enough to try it.

Kaenguerradz

Vargr term meaning "racial superiority". Most Vargr believe that their special origin makes them more important than other races. There are two versions of this philosophy.

High kaenguerradz reasons that the Ancients had specimens of all intelligent races of the time, and would have been foolish not to produce one that was better than any other.

Low kaenguerradz propounds that the Vargr were the original sapient race on Terra ( Sol / Solomani Rim 1827. Humans were genetically manipulated to produce intelligence. To keep the pre-existing Vargr from interfering in the experiments on the humans, the Ancients exterminated the Vargr on Terra after transferring a small breeding stock to Lair ( Grnrouf / Province 2408).

Khu Su'ikh

Aslan sector-wide corporation , with a territory covering the Iiyoihuakh ( Riftspan Reaches ) sector.

Khu Su'ikh maintains a benevolent monopoly on rift passage service. Its fleet includes large cargo carriers capable of for the rift crossing, and it also provides navigational information for other ships crossing the rift. This even-handed treatment makes rift crossings relatively safe. The company makes its profit from repair and re-supply services on worlds within the Great Rift.

Soon after the jump-5 route was discovered in -1044, the Wahtoi clan staked a claim to many worlds in the sector. This led to the establishment of a trading company tied to the Wahtoi clan, which soon developed a monopoly on trade across the Great Rift. In about -750, however, the Aroaye'i clan established itself as the dominant clan on Aulryakh ( ????? / Riftspan Reaches 0507). This world is the route terminus in the Aslan trans-rift colonies. After several years of clan warfare, the Aroaye'i forced the Wahtoi clan to accept them in a partnership on the trade routes across the Rift. Over the years, the participation of Aroaye'i clan females has increased to the point that the two clans are now equal partners in ownership of Khu Su'ikh. The home port of the company is Wahtoikoeakh ( ????? / Riftspan Reaches 2936), the original home of the Wahtoi clan.

Khu Su'ikh means Five Shields in Trokh, and refers to the five major worlds along the route across the Great Rift.

Kankurur-class G-Carrier
 
The Kankurur-class G-Carrier, manufactured by Ling Standard Products, is heavily used by the Scouts and Navy. Designed in 1095, the first model was commissioned in 1097. Individual models are named after significant life-forms on Imperial worlds. The kankurur itself is a large bird of prey native to Vland ( Vland / Vland 1717).

The vehicle is primarily used for survey and reconnaissance missions. Built with TL 15 construction throughout, it mounts a full array of sensors and a planetary-range meson communicator . The fusion power plant is fed by a fuel supply of 22,000 litres; this provides an operational duration of 20 full days, which equates to 60 days of 8-hour shifts. The ultra-heavy grav modules provide 99 tons of thrust, giving the G-Carrier a top speed of 240kph, with a cruising speed of 180kph and an NOE speed of 190kph.

The vehicle's sealed environment can be pressurised to provide full life-support for the crew. An aft airlock opens to the roof as well as the rear. A galley, four fold-up bunks, and a fresher allow extended missions.

EMS active and passive sensors, a neutrino sensor , and a densitometer give a full range of information to the surveyors on board. The planetary-range meson communicator allows near-instantaneous contact with any other station within planetary range. Fully loaded, the G-Carrier can carry the pilot, 5 passengers, and 27kl of cargo. It weighs 55 tons empty, and 88 tons loaded, costing MCr10.631.

Lagrange Points
Trojan Points

Lagrange Points (image from 'Basics of Space Flight - Chapter 5. Planetary Orbits', courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech)In a gravitational system composed of a small body orbiting a much larger one (such as a planet and star or a moon and planet), there are five special points in the vicinity of two orbiting masses where a third, smaller mass can orbit at a fixed distance from the larger masses. More precisely, the Lagrange Points mark positions where the gravitational pull of the two large masses precisely equals the centripetal force required to rotate with them.

Of the five Lagrange points, three are unstable and two are stable. The unstable Lagrange points - labeled L1, L2 and L3 - lie along the line connecting the two large masses. The stable Lagrange points - labeled L4 and L5 - form the apex of two equilateral triangles that have the large masses at their vertices. This means that the two stable points lie in the small bodys orbit 60 degrees ahead and behind it, and thus equidistant from the small and large bodies. These are called Trojan points.

The Trojan points of a gas giant near an asteroid belt commonly collect a cluster of asteroids. The name comes from the first such cluster discovered by Terrans at Jupiter in the Sol system: the asteroids were named after mythical heros of the fabled Trojan War on old Earth.

Tree Kraken

Tree Kraken, also known as the land squid, the tree kraken (Hexapoda stren II, H. si/vans) is a 6 kg pouncer native to the planet Forboldn ( Regina / Spinward Marches 1808), but for various reasons has become distributed to many small, low gravity worlds in the Regina (Spinward Marches) and neighbouring subsectors of the Spinward Marches. (Also see the Forboldn Project).

The adult tree kraken resembles in general body form the Terran octopus (q.v.), having a central body sensory cluster and six radiating tentacle-like arms. The internal skeleton is rudimentary, consisting of a cartilaginous stiffening of the body to permit the lung sacs to function, to serve as attachment points for the muscles, and to permit leverage for the three part mandible located at the base of the arms. This stiffening appears to be an adaption to a terrestrial lifestyle.

The arms of the kraken consist of a stiffened central support structure surrounded by a muscular sheath. The arms end in from 2 to 7 (depending on species) smaller appendages. The ventral surface of the arm, and the ends of these smaller appendages are equipped with a disk-shaped sucker-like organ covered with hundreds of small, razor-sharp tooth-like structures.

The eyes are paired, operate stereoscopically, and permit the kraken to detect the faintest movement at several hundred meters. Range judgement is extremely good.

Respiration is accomplished by 3 to 8 (varying with species) lung-sacs located in the body mass. Each sac has its own connection to the atmosphere. To function, the inner lining of each sac must be kept moist, requiring the kraken to remain in regions of high humidity, such as marshes, swamps, or jungles. Tree krakens have a closed circularory system and are endothermic.

The kraken attacks its prey by leaping upon it from a height, usually a tree, but often a cliff and occasionally a roof. The arms wrap around the prey, immobilizing it and the disk-shaped structures abrade the skin and other tissue into small fragments which are then conveyed to the mouth.

After feeding, the tree kraken climbs to a high place for protection from other predators, and goes into a digestive torpor, from which it emerges several hours later.

Krakens are hermaphroditic, and reproduction is accomplished by budding. During the six week mating season, two krakens will meet, and exchange genetic material by means of two tubelike structures located above the eyes. After fertilization, these structures swell to several times their normal size and grow arms, eventually (after eight to twelve weeks) becoming fully developed miniature krakens. When fully developed, the young detach themselves and go their own way. This is accomplished when the parent is in a state of torpor after feeding, otherwise the krakens would eat their own young.

Worlds with known tree kraken populations include Forboldn, Menorb ( Regina / Spinward Marches 1803), Kinorb ( Regina / Spinward Marches 2202), Jesedipere ( Aramis / Spinward Marches 3001), Aramanx ( Aramis / Spinward Marches 3005), Extolay ( Lanth / Spinward Marches 1711), and Dinomn ( Lanth / Spinward Marches 1912). It is rumoured that the tree kraken's liver contains compounds useful in the manufacture of anagathics.

Lasers

Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Devices which emit concentrated light energy in beams or pulses. Lasers can be tools or weapons.

As tools, lasers can be used in such diverse tasks as surgical operations or welding.

As weapons, lasers can range from hand-held to ship-mounted weapons. They are perhaps the most versatile weapons yet developed.

Ship-mounted lasers cause damage to the exterior surfaces of enemy targets. Pulse lasers fire short bursts of high energy at targets, and are more effective at inflicting damage than are beam lasers. Beam lasers fire continuous beams of energy at targets, and are more effective at hitting than are pulse lasers.

Leviathan-class Merchant Cruiser

Designed jointly by Bilstein Yards of Glisten ( Glisten / Spinward Marches 0406) and Baraccai Technum, the Leviathan-class was developed from previous designs and primarily intended for independent cruising in undeveloped trade areas. High survivability is a prime design factor in this merchant cruiser .

The vessel is semi-streamlined, allowing skimming refuelling manoeuvres as well as landings in types 0 and 1 atmospheres. Atmospheric landings are otherwise impossible, hence the large complement of ship's boats.

Bilstein has made the design available for general sale, and fifteen have been completed (of which three have been lost), four are being built, and two are on order.

Arian Lisiani

Captain Arian Lisiani began her career in the Imperial Navy in 220, joining the Flight Branch as a graduate of the prestigious Imperial School on Sylea ( Core / Core 2118). Her early career achievements were mixed. After distinguishing herself in the discovery and assimilation of some border states of Ilelish sector, she was cashiered for insubordination during hostilities with the Aslan. Lisiani was reinstated after intervention by Admiral Voseyevski, a classmate at the Imperial School.

Lisiani distinguished herself in exploits during the Aslan Border Wars. As a Captain temporarily commanding a pursuit squadron, she directed forces in the relief of Warinir ( Edge / Daibei 0517) after it was occupied by an Aslan expedition. The relief was successful, and the Aslan were driven from the system. Lisiani personally commanded the cruiser which diverted the main Aslan fleet away from Warinir ; with her ship severely damaged, she managed to close on the Aslan command ship and destroy it before she was herself destroyed.

Arian Lisiani was awarded the Starburst for Extreme Heroism posthumously. There has been a ship in the Imperial Navy named for her continuously since 345. The current vessel is a 5000-ton P. F. Sloan-class Fleet Escort, built in 1037 at Mora ( Mora / Spinward Marches 3124).

Lowalaa

Stylised Lowalaa, Family symbol of Duchess MargaretA bird traditionally symbolizing trust, caring, and loyalty. The Lowalaa has earned this reputation for its many positive characteristics. They are common pets, especially among the nobility, in the regions of the Imperium stretching from Delphi to the thumb of the Great Rift.

The Lowalaa (Lowalaa Columbaformis Curatis) is native to Ituxi ( Aklan / Delphi 0722). It was transported to Anaxias ( Anaxias / Delphi 1724) during the First Imperium to control the local equivalent of insects. Its ability to adapt to the new environment was underestimated, however, and the population rapidly exceeded that of its homeworld. It is now the most common aviform on Anaxias , where it is popularly known as the Flying Grace.

The most remarkable characteristic of the Lowalaa is its colourful plumage, for which the Lasias Lowalaa is particularly noted. Each bird displays different colours and patterns; a record of the food sources it was exposed to. In the wild, birds with certain markings will be looked to as guides to certain nutritional needs of the flock. In captivity, their diet is managed with extreme care to create the desired effects. Special additives have even made such things as silver or luminous birds.

The other ability, most notable in the Thrumet Lowalaa, is mimicry. Lowalaas do not have the same vocal fidelity as some Terran birds, but they can learn short tunes. This talent extends to learning somatic patterns - in effect, dancing. Using bird puppets as training aids, entertainment troops have devised some very impressive acts with Lowalaas.

Their intelligence and trainability are chiefly credited for the Lowalaa's popularity, both as pets and working birds. On low tech worlds, they are often used as very dependable messengers and spotters.

The Lowalaa is highly adaptable. It can adjust to environmental extremes very well, but not to solitude. Its health will soon fail if a Lowalaa is frequently left alone. For this reason, they are often kept in mated pairs. Lowalaas mate for life and readily breed in captivity. Females will lay a clutch of two to five eggs every two to twelve months in the wild, varying with the world. Breeders, however, can hasten the mating cycle or halt it indefinitely. The life expectancy of a Lowalaa is 12 to 15 years.

Lowalaas are very flexible in the construction of nests, even having been known to use electrical wire and mylar tape to good effect. Once the eggs are laid, both the male and female become very defensive of their nest, with other Lowalaas joining in. It is rare for even the owner to be permitted to touch the eggs.

The bird was adopted as the family symbol of Prince Asan , brother of Emperor Paulo III . After Paulo had ascended the throne in 1031, Asan was awarded a duchy in Delphi sector. Asan moved to Delphi and later married Marian , the daughter of Delphi 's senior duke. This established his family line as the senior one in the sector.

The current holder of the duchy is Duchess Margaret of Anaxias ( Anaxias / Delphi 1724).

McClellan Factors

An interface line which operates in the rimward area of the Spinward Marches, connecting the Marches with the nearest worlds of the Outrim Void.

McClellan Factors have cornered the market in District 268 after a long and bitter fight with Baraccai Technum.

The main regional base of the company is Mertactor ( District 268 / Spinward Marches 1537), with advance facilities at Trexalon ( District 268 / Spinward Marches 1339). In the Egryn subsector, facilities are maintained on Walei ( Egryn / Trojan Reach 0902), Kaldamar ( Egryn / Trojan Reach 1201), Nabeth ( Egryn / Trojan Reach 1202), Ashley's Rock ( Egryn / Trojan Reach 1601), and T'yana ( Egryn / Trojan Reach 1602).

On T'yana ( Egryn / Trojan Reach 1602), tensions between McClellan Factors and Baraccai Technum are running high. McClellan Factors views any extension of BT influence into Egryn as a serious threat.

MagnetoDynamics, Inc

Established in 1040 with an Imperial charter and a mineral exploitation grant for Fulacin ( Rhylanor / Spinward Marches 2613). The corporation holds several patents for the recovery of precious and heavy metals from atmospheric and oceanic suspension, and originally obtained its position on Fulacin for the use of these properties.

Following the severe economic downturn associated with the False War (1082 to 1084), the company encountered a cash slowdown, and suspended operations for a period. In 1089, an influx of capital allowed the company to resume operations. In partial support of this new era, the company also established a large starport facility (currently class A minus ) with construction and overhaul facilities to 10,000 tons. The starport was completed in 1099.

MagnetoDynamics' exploration grant expires in 1199, with a renewability clause for an additional 100 years upon demonstration of efficient and profitable operations.

Makhidkarun


Makhidkarun specializes in the entertainment and communications industries. It produces fine musical recordings of all types, two- and three-dimensional movies, books, magazines, and art reproductions.

The Communication Division produces a wide variety of data processing, storage, and retrieval equipment, plus the requisite software for it.

The Gourmet Foods Division trades in all manner of rare and expensive foods, wines, and delicacies.

The Arean Transport subsidiary operates luxury liners which set the standard for fine cuisine and cruises throughout the Imperium. Makhidkarun also provides passenger and freight services throughout the Imperium, although operations are confined to established trade routes.

The Robotics Division has established Makhidkarun as the most innovative robotics manufacturer in the Imperium. Its research staff is responsible for many of the Imperium's significant breakthroughs in synaptic processing. In 298, Makhidkarun introduced the first line of tech level 13 robot brains. It revolutionized the popularity of robots in the Third Imperium by making robots usable by every citizen. In 711, it created the first prototype tech level 14 robot brain.

The origins of the company are shrouded in the mists of the Long Night . All that can be stated with certainty is that its foundation pre-dates the Third Imperium. The name, at least, belonged to a Vilani bureau that operated in the First Imperium.

Maneuver Drive

Ships move through ordinary space using maneuver drives. Power for the drives is provided by the ship's power plant . Tech level requirements for maneuver drives are imposed to cover the grav plates integral to most ship decks, and which allow high-G maneuvers while interior G-fields remain normal.

Maneuver drives can be made up either of grav modules or thruster plates, which both make use of the graviton.

Gravitic drives produce a field which alters the way incoming gravitons react with the ship, allowing them to be used for thrust.

Thrusters are more advanced. A combined spin-off of gravitic and damper technology, thruster technology uses a strong molecular repelling force, reacting with both the strong and weak nuclear forces, to create a reactionless drive. Thrusters do not require the presence of a large gravity field to operate efficiently, thus are usable even outside of a gravity well. They are highly localized with virtually none of the projection ability of anti-grav.

Thruster plates are usually mounted in the aft of a ship, as they tend to build up a slight ionisation field around them. This is generally bled off into space.

Menderes Corporation

A bi-racial, non-Imperial megacorporation.

The Menderes Corporation is involved in freight and cargo transportation, courier services, starship construction, military hardware, heavy manufacturing, electronics, and resources investments. Based in the Julian Protectorate , their merchants range from Vargr Extents and Antares sector to the Windhorn Rift .

The company emphasises its mercantile nature, downplaying its social policies as mere attempts to foster a more lucrative commercial environment. For instance, for centuries it has promoted and sponsored kuspar, floater and sailball - today the most popular sports in the Julian Protectorate . Importantly, these sports all make use of mixed Vargr-human teams, deliberately being designed to highlight the two races' complementary abilities and skills.

This reflects the way Menderes functions. Vargr tend to occupy certain positions within the company, humans others. The organisation has tailored itself to take the most advantage of the strengths of both species.

The company was formed about the time of the Nth Interstellar War (-2235 to -2219) when a family of Solomani traders, the Menderes, established lucrative trade routes along the Mendan Main . Later, many Solomani entrepreneurs in the area were appointed planetary governors when Emperor Hiroshi II came to power. A few such posts went to the Menderes family, among them that of Asimikigir ( Julian / Amdukan 0223). The family established a commercial dynasty spanning all of Asimikigir that endured the entire Long Night , and effectively became a monopoly. This objective was maintained when it broke into space again in -247, spreading into former Imperial space. However, the rise of the Sylean corporations was an unwelcome intrusion into the Menderes economic sphere. The Pacification Campaigns (76 to 120) were paralled by trade wars that ultimately forced the Menderes Corporation out of Lishun , Antares , and The Empty Quarter .

The Julian War (175 to 191) was the final Imperial push into the Mendan sector, occupied by the Asimikigir Confederation . Julian Menderes , the then head of the Menderes Corporation and Confederation regent, rallied both the humans and Vargr into a protectorate against the Imperium. Combining Vargr resourcfulness and human determination, the protectorate's forces, called the Star Legion , repulsed the Imperial fleets from the region by 185. They continued to press into the Imperium to force a formal treaty, finally given in 191. With victory achieved, the Julian Protectorate transformed itself into a permanent organisation. Ever since, the Menderes Corporation has jealously guarded its remaining markets and routes among the Vargr Extents.

Interests: Transport, ship components, military hardware, heavy equipment.

Home Port: Asimikigir ( Julian / Amdukan 0223).

Merchant Cruisers

A generic term applied to vessels specifically assigned to independent missions, the prime objective of which is market discovery and acquisition, either in isolation or in competition with other merchant operators. Design parameters for such vessels usually include a high level of weaponry and auxiliary boats in proportion to their cargo capacity and all possible back-up systems, along with high structural integrity.

One example of a merchant cruiser is the Leviathan-class.

Misjump

An unpredictable random jump, caused by a faulty jump transition. The worst effect of a misjump is total destruction of the craft at the time of jump transition. Other misjumps are classified according to their effects: temporal, spatial, or combined.

In a temporal misjump, the craft reaches the intended destination, but a jump time duration error occurs (also known as a jump relativity error). In such cases, the amount of time the craft spends in jumpspace may vary from 40% to 160% of normal. In many cases, this is nothing more than an inconvenience to the passengers and crew. In fact, the craft may arrive ahead of schedule. However, in extreme cases, the voyage may take so long that supplies dwindle and life support or fuel reserves fail. When this happens, the ship emerges from jumpspace with no survivors.

A spatial misjump causes the craft to arrive at a point in space other than its intended destination, although the time spent in jump falls within the normal range. This is caused by the ship entering a higher level of jumpspace than intended. Sometimes a jump-6 will be reduced to a mere jump-1, or a jump-1 converted into a jump-10, 20, or higher. The highest recorded misjumps have covered 36 parsecs. Often these misjumps are disastrous, because there is no assurance that the craft will emerge anywhere near a star system. A ship which finds itself stranded between systems, without fuel, is almost certainly doomed. About the only recourse is for the ship to vector toward the nearest star and accelerate to the limit of its maneuver fuel. At 0.1 lightspeed, a system one parsec away will still take over 30 years to reach. The only hope for the occupants is to strap themselves into low berths for the duration of the trip.

A combined misjump is a dramatic event which causes the travellers to be subjected to combined effects of both a temporal and a spatial misjump.

There are two common causes of misjumps. The chief cause is gravitational perturbations. It is possible to enter jumpspace from anywhere, even from the surface of a planet, but some points are more hazardous than others. Any nearby mass (even another starship) distorts the fabric of space and jumpspace, making jumpspace transition a dangerous task. Between 10 and 100 diameters, the effect gradually drops off; jumps within this range are considered hazardous and should be avoided. Beyond 100 diameters, jumpspace transition is considered safe, as long as no other factor adversely affects the procedure.

The second most common cause is contaminated fuel. On rare occasions, an unusual gas mix in the fuel causes the jump drive power plant to load the zuchai crystals with a charge that is ever-so-slightly skewed, and a misjump occurs. The detection systems in Scout and military jump drive governors are more sensitive to such variations in the zuchai crystal charge. This enables them to compensate for such variations, making them more resistant to misjumps caused by unrefined fuel.

Other misjumps are caused by faulty drive components, such as a fracture in a zuchai crystal or damage to the lanthanum hull grid.

Missiles

Missiles are projectiles designed to impact with or detonate near a target in order to inflict damage on it. Many types of missiles are available to the armed forces of the Imperium and its neighbours.

Missiles are made up of three major sub-systems: the launcher, the delivery sub-system, and the warhead.

The launcher is usually little more than a protective rack which holds the missile until launch.

Once fired, the delivery sub-system takes over, steering the missile towards the target. The sub-system is made up of motor, guidance controls, and detonation controls. The motor can be liquid or solid fuel thrusters or a gravitic drive. The guidance can be by operator, radar, or homing (by infrared seeking, mass seeking, neutrino seeking, etc). Detonation is controlled by a trigger: contact, proximity, intelligent, or command.

The warhead falls into two broad catagories: conventional and nuclear. Conventional covers standard high-explosive (HE) and focussed force high-explosive; these can only cause surface damage. Nuclear covers fission, fusion, and enhanced radiation; these missiles cause both surface damage and radiation effects. Note that under the Imperial Rules of War, nuclear missiles are reserved for use by Imperial forces only.

Standard missiles designed for space combat come in two sizes: the larger are designed to be launched from missile bays, and the smaller from missile racks. The latter weigh about 50 kg and cost Cr50,000 each.

Such anti-ship missiles may also be converted to planetary surface bombs, or to surveillance drones (mechanical and electrical skill would apply in such cases).

Monadium

Impenetrable bluish-gray metal used as the basic construction material by the Ancients at the site on Antiquity ( Ian / Corridor 0816). It has defeated all efforts to determine its exact composition; some experts believe it contains titanium. Even modern TL 15 plasma and fusion weapons have been unable to penetrate it.

^^^^

Monitor

Large spaceship with armament equivalent to a battleship, used primarily for system defence roles. Generally based on a planetoid hull (and so automatically unstreamlined), these craft depend heavily on pre-positioned caches and fuel shuttles.

The large size of these craft make them generally impossible to move inter-system. Like battle riders, they are in a conquer-or-die situation if facing superior forces. Their deterrent value is therefore fragile as well as powerful.

Mora

Capital of the Spinward Marches, and site of the first major Imperial establishment in that sector.

Mora ( Mora / Spinward Marches 3124) was settled in 60 and financed by Ling Standard Products. It was soon a thriving trade centre, building new ships, overhauling old ones, and producing other manufactured goods on the side. At one end of the trade routes through to the Sword Worlds Confederation and the Darrians, Mora became known as the "Gateway to the Marches".

Mora sits fairly near the centre of the Domain of Deneb , astride the Spinward Main. The bulk of the world's 10 billion population resides in a sprawling mega-city, straddling the equator and covering most of the major continent. The Duchess Delphine currently holds the reins of power in the world's matriarchy.

The Mora system's belt is home to most of the significant biotech industries in the Spinward Marches. The belt environment has provided tham with a safe and flexible environment for research while being positioned at a large nexus of trade routes.

Mora has two asteroidal moons of great age. Current theories hold that they are cometary remains.

Nuclear Damper
Damper Box

Nuclear dampers are passive defensive devices which create an interference field in which the strong nuclear force can be manipulated. A series of nodes and anti-nodes are created, either to enhance or degrade the strong nuclear force.

Focussing a negative node on incoming nuclear warheads lowers the potential barriers around nuclei, thus suppressing the strong force; the warheads shed neutrons at very low energies and are rendered harmless after a short exposure. Both fission and fusion warheads are affected, as fusion warheads use a fission trigger to create the heat required for the fusion reaction.

Dampers may also be used to eliminate radioactive contamination from an area. The damper is focussed on the contamination and forces the radioactive particles to shed radiation until they are inert.

Nuclear dampers may be mounted in spaceships or on vehicles. A damper unit consists of three components: two separate damper projectors and a fire control system. Shipboard dampers are generally mounted as far apart as possible, and contain an integral fire control system for efficiency.

A further development of the nuclear damper is the damper box. This focusses a positive node on its contents, raising the potential barrier and preventing nuclear decay. Damper boxes are used to store collapsing rounds, allowing materials with short usable half-lives to be used as ammunition.

Oberlindes Lines

Logo of Oberlindes LinesOberlindes Lines is an interface line trading between the Imperium in the Spinward Marches and the Vargr in neighbouring Gvurrdon . It is a major shipping company in the Regina subsector ( Spinward Marches ).

The Oberlindes name is an old one in the trade and commerce business in the Marches. Roxanne Oberlindes established the first line to bear the name in 487, and built up a large family business from a free trader operation. The company thrived between each of the several wars which have wracked the Marches in the past half-millenium.

The first major increase in Oberlindes' size came in 1049 with the acquisition of the Emissary, a Azhanti High Lightning-class frontier cruiser declared surplus by the Imperial Navy. This ship, armaments intact, served as the flagship for Oberlindes' excusions into the Vargr Extents on trade expeditions; the venture proved highly successful. A base was established just beyond the Imperial border (some irregularities in the ship transfer made it impractical to bring the ship into the Imperium) and served as a clearing house for trade good shipments between Regina ( Regina / Spinward Marches 1910) and the Vargr worlds.

Following the Fourth Frontier War, the company obtained an Imperial charter (1084) and naval surplus transports. They used them to provide extensive cargo service in the Regina subsector, concentrating on the smaller feeder routes. This proved to be most lucrative, as worlds cut off by the fighting had a high demand for trade goods. At the same time, Oberlindes expanded into trade with the Vargr just beyond the Imperial border, and has become a major importer of Vargr products and goods.

More recently, the line has expanded into main line service, in direct competition with Tukera Lines and other established major shipping lines. Expansion into neighbouring subsectors has improved interstellar service for travellers, but has alienated many of the older and more conservative lines.

Marc hault-Oberlindes , patriarch and controller of the line, was awarded a baronial patent, complete with estates on Feri ( Regina / Spinward Marches 2005), by direction of the Emperor in 1101. The patent was in recognition of his contribution to economic recovery in the Marches following the Fourth Frontier War. His heir apparent is his son, Sergei hault-Oberlindes . Sergei was recently (1105) rescued from imprisonment on Ruie ( Regina / Spinward Marches 1809).

Home Port: Regina ( Regina / Spinward Marches 1910).

Territory: Regina and Aramis subsectors; Vargr territory in adjacent Gvurrdon sector.

Current Owner: Marc hault-Oberlindes . Stock Ownership: Oberlindes family, 78%; Imperial Family, 2%; corporate employees, 8%; investment trusts, 10%; public (individuals), 2%.

Current Fleet: the commercial fleet consists of more than 100 ships, which includes the Emissary (an  Azhanti High Lightning -class frontier cruiser), 9 other ships of greater than 4000 tons and 30 other ships of greater than 1000 tons.

Onnesium

Rare element, atomic number 118, mildly radioactive and dangerous, which has been proved to be a viable room-temperature superconductor.

Onnesium is normally found as small, silvery spheres embedded within meteoric nickel-iron. It is created within supernovae, plated onto asteroidal surfaces, and eventually can be discovered in free-floating asteroids or in impact craters on planetary surfaces.

Recent discoveries of onnesium in the Gavza system ( Scotian Deep / Reaver's Deep 1117) have suggested that a supernova at Scotian Deep ( Scotian Deep / Reaver's Deep 1118) may have spread onnesium deposits to several nearby systems in the Scotian Deep subsector.

Orbital Complexes

Orbital complexes  are large artificial satellites, capable of sustaining life. They range in size from single stations up to large, sprawling cities. Complexes can be joined in a daisy-chain arrangement, or simply a group of closely proximate individual complexes in the same orbit. Three general size catagories exist: orbital stations, orbital settlements, and orbital cities.

An orbital station is a single large satellite used as an orbital installation, with a permanent population in the tens. Often built as a modular unit, able to be expanded upon as necessary. Some standard station types include refuelling station, communications station, research station, fighter base, peace monitor, civilian transfer station (for personnel and/or cargo), or drydock control centre. Possible at TL 7.

An orbital settlement is an open-cycle orbital station with a permanent population in the hundreds. Possible at TL 8.

The largest of the orbital complexes, an orbital city is a closed-cycle orbital station with a permanent population in the thousands. Possible at TL 9.

Ormine

Intelligent minor race native to a world in Akhlare subsector ( Dark Nebula ). The Ormine are a very long-lived race with some characteristics resembling Terran reptiles. Their metabolism is slow, with a minimal homeothermic response to keep them from actually freezing.

Ormine are upright, short-legged bipeds with a short, flat tail for balance. Their arms are also relatively short and the hands partly webbed. They are covered with jointed plates rather like the armour of a Terran armadillo. Their origin was obviously aquatic and they retain several adaptions that make them at home in the water, including gills which open and activate upon diving.

The lifespan of the Ormine is about 300 standard years, with maturity coming at 30 standard years. The elders of a community are its leaders, and serve for life once chosen. Understandably, Ormine culture is slow-moving and very conservative. On their own, they have never developed past TL 8.

The Solomani arrival 3,000 years ago was a severe cultural shock. Solomani spacers were impatient with the deliberate movements of the councils that negotiated with them, while the Ormine for the most part thought the Solomani rude, impetuous, and thoughtless.

Human technological superiority, however, was undeniable. This attracted some few younger Ormine minds. With every human visit, some Ormine took passage to new worlds. Colonies grew up on several suitable planets and some unsuitable ones. The technology to conquer the inhospitable worlds was supplied by the Solomani in exchange for work contracts and pledges of loyalty. This has meant that most of the Gerontocracy of Ormine is deeply in debt to the Solomani and is part of their political sphere.

The Ormine retain their rule by elders, but those elders usually have a human "advisor". Any who express their disapproval of this too strongly may find themselves exiled to one of the less pleasant worlds.

Orpheides

Intelligent minor race native to Orphee ( New Islands / Reft 1429). Descended from herbivorous grazer stock, the Orpheides have only achieved rudimentary development (approximating TL 0). Despite this, their culture at that level has proven of interest to academics throughout the Island Clusters .

It is expected that the Orpheides, with suitable protection from interference, can achieve a technological civilisation within a few thousand years. To this end, Orphee itself has been interdicted (making it the equivalent of a Red Zone within the Imperium).

Oynprith

The common language of the Droyne.

For centuries, only the vast distances separating Droyne worlds from each other concealed the fact that they all had a common language. That is not to say that every Droyne spoke the same language; indeed, different Droyne communities spoke different languages, often very different languages. However, all Droyne communities shared one common language - Oynprith, the language used in the coyn casting ceremony. Outsiders missed Oynprith simply because it was not used in public very often; it had a status as a ritual or ceremonial language, much like the status of Latin on Terra ( Sol / Solomani Rim 1827).

In interstellar commerce, Oynprith was soon discovered by Droyne to be a universal language among their race; as trade increased, Oynprith became more commonly used, finally reaching a status as the universal Droyne language.

Particle Accelerator

Device for accelerating a particle of matter to speeds approaching the speed of light, creating a measurable increase in its mass. While some use gravitic acceleration mechanisms, most use powerful electrical and/or magnetic fields to accelerate ions or charged subatomic particles.

The particle accelerator has been made into a very effective weapon. The same fields that accelerate the particles are used to focus them into concentrated beams, able to attack distant targets. Hits from these particle accelerator weapons (PAWs) produce surface and radiation damage.

Charged particle accelerator weapons (C-PAWs) fire charged particles. These propagate well through atmosphere (behaving like an electrical current flowing in one direction), but scatter in vacuum (due to magnetic replusion).

Neutral particle accelerator weapons (N-PAWs) fire charged particles through a device (foil screen, gas filter, or high-power laser) which strips off an electron or adds a proton. The resultant beam is neutrally charged. These beams break up rapidly in atmosphere, but perform flawlessly in space.

Thus, N-PAWs are the space weapons, and C-PAWs are the ground weapons.

Research PAWs are generally curved, while military PAWs are generally straight. This allows military designs to be less complicated and more able to withstand battle damage.

PDPT-beta

Chemical compound discovered by Seaharvester scientists in the corpse of a pre-reproductive phase daghadasi specimen in 1101. The full name of the compound, cis-1,2 paradichlorotriethylaminoprocyclohepatrenyl-4-tricyclo-hexene-beta, is rarely used.

The chemical serves as the basis for a family of experimental broad-spectrum antibiotics which can be selectively "tuned" to wipe out specific types of bacterial, viral, and cancerous growths, while leaving adjacent benign growths untouched. Thus far, no synthesis of the chemical has been produced, and no source other than the daghadasi oguls has been discovered.

Battle of Porozlo (980)

The Zhodani thrust (in the Third Frontier War) via Vilis and Lanth subsectors to Rhylanor ( Rhylanor / Spinward Marches 2716) met a known problem - Rhylanor has no gas giant, but does have a strong naval base. Neighbouring Porozlo ( Rhylanor  / Spinward Marches 2715) had a gas giant for quick refuelling, and also possessed a naval base of potential use to invading naval forces.

The battle began when a single large Zhodani task force appeared off Porozlo's primary; it proceeded directly to the larger of the two gas giants in the system. The local naval base reacted immediately, even admirably, considering that there was no warning of Zhodani this far from the front lines. However, as the first Zhodani task force refuelled, portions of it engaged the local defences, occupying them as a second task force appeared and drove straight for Porozlo. The threat of action against the planetary defences & facilities prompted the world organisation to declare Porozlo an open world. Naval forces either surrendered or jumped to safety at Rhylanor .

The fall of Porozlo gave the Zhodani a supporting base for their seige of Rhylanor . Ships could easily refuel at the gas giant, jump-1 parsec to Rhylanor for raids, attacks, or blockade patrols, and still have enough fuel to jump back to Porozlo where a class A starport and the captured naval base stood ready to repair any damage immediately.

The naval defences of Porozlo have been strengthened considerably since 986.

Postal Union

A group of political units associated to a greater or lesser degree for the purpose of communication among citizens, businesses, and governmental units.

Nearly all star systems are members of one postal union or another. Governments cooperate along their borders in order to allow the efficient flow of communications between them. Members of a postal union forward mail through their territories (subject, of course, to local security needs, acts of war, and so on) to the proper addresses.

On the average, communication is at the speed of the fastest available transportation, usually about three or four parsecs a week.

Prison Hulk

The former Imperial battle cruiser Gaesh has been paid off and converted to penal rehabilitation at an orbital site above Pixie ( Regina / Spinward Marches 1903). Modern reform and rehabilitation methods are used on a variety of Imperial offenders in a setting removed from normal pressure and routine; the Ministry of Justice reports excellent results in its programs, with a recidivism rate approaching zero.

The orbiting prison is an interesting study in economy, converting an otherwise useless starship to an important social institution. The two upper decks have been retained for guard crew quarters and essential administration, while the three lower decks have been turned over to the inmates for quarters and recreation.

Prt'

Intelligent minor race native to Prt'aow ( ????? / Spica ????), evolved from once-domesticated carnivore/pouncers. They are bipedal, but can move on all fours at greater speed. Averaging about 1 m in height and 25 to 30 kg in weight, their most distinguishing feature is a slight external resemblance to the Felidae (cats) of Terra ( Sol / Solomani Rim 1827), causing one observer to characterise them as "overgrown tomcats".

The main difference between the Prt' and their wild forebears are a greater overall body size, an enlarged cranium, and the development of the forepaw into a stubby-fingered hand, allowing the manufacture and use of tools. The greatest overall difference is, of course, their sapience.

The Prt' (pronounced "pert" with a rolled "r" and emphasis on the "t") were created by a race they call the Hasst'kor (lit. "those who came before"). Known only through legend, the Hasst'kor seem to have bio-engineered simple carnivore/pouncers for use as a servitor race. About -10,000 Imperial, the Hasst'kor were destroyed in an interplanetary war with their neighbours. The Prt' were left as the only intelligent life on the planet, their population drastically reduced by chemical assaults and the bio-plagues which eradicated their former masters. Taking to the wilds to avoid these hazards, the Prt' lived a brutish and primitive existence for millenia, slowly creating their own clan culture. Eventually, some clans ventured back into the ruins, and discovered some stockpiles of Hasst'kor technology. These "civilised" clans prospered, rising to TL 1 while the rest remained at TL 0.

About -2400 Imperial, a Hiver expedition discovered the planet. Contacting a few reckless clans, they decided to uplift the Prt' to a civilised level. Soon, the Prt' were accompanying the Hivers on scouting expeditions through the stars. To this day, despite somewhat violent ways, the Prt' remain very active on both Hiver exploration services.

Archaeological study of the Hasst'kor has revealed little. It is clear that the third and fourth planets were occupied by sentient races. Those of the third were the Hasst'kor, a race of roughly Solomani size and shape. More is not known; none of their likenesses have been found. Their technology was about TL 9, but without jump; however, their bio-tech was about TL 16. Of their mentality, the only demonstration is that of the fourth planet, stripped of life and pock-marked with craters. It is hypothesised that crude anti-matter ordnance was used to wipe out the race that lived there.

Prt' society is dominated by the clan system, similar to, but not as restrictive as Aslan clan hierarchy. Government is by a council of clan elders, who hold frequent meetings to decide policy for a population - a sporadic form of government. These elders also decide policy for their own clans, male elders making most of the decisions, with final approval coming from the females. Every Prt' of 60+ is automatically an elder; some are honoured with this status as young as 40 (usually for some great service). One small, specialised clan handles all the bureaucracy, including contact with off-worlders.

The planetary armed forces are also maintained by the clans, primarily being volunteer militia. Since the Hive Federation handles the defence of space, their primary function seems to be competition to determine which unit is the most impressive. These wargames also serve as the Prt' equivalent of organised sports.

One other event of interest is the Kha'i (rite of passage), a ritual combat that marks the entry of a male Prt' into adulthood. Held bi-annually between clans, adolescent males compete against one another to prove their strength and suitability as mates - a traditional function which still has influence on the females attending. Males not selected often leave their clans for a while to further prove their suitability by questing in unknown territory. This often translates into starfaring.

Prt'aow (lit. "Home") is a member of the Hive Federation, and Hiver influence is pervasive (for example, written Prt' uses Hiver idiographs). The Prt' can boast of their service to the Hiver Exploration Service . Their closest neighbours, the Solomani, retain friendly but patronising relations with them. On the whole, the Solomani are not favourites of the Prt', due to the Solomani view of them as large housecats. The Prt' are familiar with the Imperium, and many have gained Imperial citizenship through service with the IISS, a favourite career of questing Prt'.

Two entire clans have moved to the Aslan Hierate, serving as assistants to Aslan corporations and clans, usually as interpreters in human-Aslan meetings. The Aslan appreciate the Prt' ability to tolerate human insults and gaffes without becoming mortally insulted (they are still "touchy" from a human standpoint, however). Occasionally, Prt' have served as mediatiors between Aslan clans, being recognised as neutral parties.

Pseudo-Reality Communication

Communication via a specially programmed pseudo-reality computer. The computer queries the sender of the message extensively, building up a large database about both the person and the message. It can then act as a stand-in for the sender when delivering the message. The recipient can discuss the message with a computer image of the sender, just as if they were physically present.

Psionic Games

A continuing competition held by the Zhodani government for excellence in psionic achievement. They were first established in -6731 Imperial, the point at which the Zhodani dating system begins.

The Psionic Games are held on Zhdant ( Gavel / Zhdant 2719) once every olympiad, for a period of nearly four weeks. The participants (mostly Intendants) are selected by the various ruling councils, and preliminary competitions are held to reduce the numbers to manageable size. Intendants who do well in the Games are elevated to noble status (about 1 in 7 are elevated in this way).

The Zhodani system provides psionic training to all nobles and to the Intendant class. This means that the Psionic Games are a popular device for the masses to see the powers of their rulers in action. Competition is staged in nearly all fields of psionics, including telekinetic weight-lifting, distance and accuracy teleportation, and many other events.

Psychohistory

The science of historical prediction and macro-social manipulation. The main thesis is that the actions of trillions of individuals take on a fluidity and predictability which can be compared to that of molecules in gas. The very size of the population being dealt with factors out individual peculiarities and allows the prediction of its behavior. With the ability to predict the reaction of a population to a particular stimulus, comes the ability to manipulate that population, psychohistorians reason.

Psychohistory began as a combination of public relations/advertising techniques and behavioral science. Although its techniques have been put on a more rigorous footing, the basic principles are still not well understood. A number of minor experiments have confirmed the general validity of the science, but it was also shown to be too expensive to be of any practical utility. Research continues at a small number of Imperial universities.

Restricted: The real reason large-scale psychohistory experiments no longer occur is due to the unpredictable results of the only sizable experiment to date, conducted as a part of the Psionics Suppressions. The unforeseen results of this were so far-reaching that Imperial scientists concluded that their knowledge of the principles involved was woefully inadequate, and that further study was required. Imperial research continues at a small number of strictly controlled research stations.

Psionics Suppressions
800 to 826

The revelation of scandals (financial, ethical, and moral) within the psionics institutes in the years 772 to 798 resulted in a shift in public opinion against the institutes. Over a 26-year period, various institute charters were cancelled, leading figures jailed or otherwise repressed, and restrictive laws passed limiting or prohibiting the practice of psionics. Many institute figures went underground, to espouse their cause in a type of guerilla war.

Popular prejudice against psionics continues to the present day. The average citizen will admit to a general dislike of psionics, and if pressed, will usually state that psionics violates a person's right to mental privacy.

Historian Albert Croale raised an alternative theory for the Suppressions, which he called the "Crisis of '99".

Restricted: In the latter half of the 700's, high Imperial figures (the Office of the Emperor and the Intelligence Agency ) became convinced that the psionics institutes within the region spinward of Corridor sector (about 60% of all institutes ) were being financed, at least in part, by Zhodani money. Indeed, there is a natural affinity between the institutes and the Zhodani (with their long-standing history of psionics study and training). The Zhodani were believed to be laying the ground-work for a "fifth column" to operate in Imperial space during a war planned to break out between 810 and 820. The Imperium moved to combat this.

Evidence of scandal was uncovered (or fabricated) and released, with careful attention to public opinion. Simultaneously, high level officials at the sector and subsector levels were apprised of the true situation, and both the Zhodani and Vargr states were informed (through private channels) that the Imperium knew of the upcoming war and was prepared for it. War was averted, but the supressions succeeded far better than the Imperium had envisioned. Public opinion swung widely against psionics and became solidified in the form of strong local laws and customs. The suppression campaign continued for twenty-six years before its formal halt. Many small, local campaigns have occurred since. The strong anti-psionic feeling engendered in the public has even made it difficult for the Imperium to use psionics for its own, official purposes.

The cancellation of the charters of the various psionics institutes effectively removed them from the community. They have continued to exist only because psionics gives such an important advantage against law enforcement officials.

Sixty-five psionics institutes held Imperial charters in 800. The suppression orders issued by Paula II , appearing over a period of 10 years, first "suppressed" the various charters (rendering them temporarily suspended) and then revoked tham at a later date. 65 suppression orders were issued, numbers 2 through 66 (SO1 was a general order to the realm concerning the issue) followed by 65 orders for revokation (SO67 to SO131). Of these, actual records indicate that SO83 and SO96 were themselves revoked by orders published elsewhere. The result is that a cursory examination of the SO files will reveal all Imperial charters of psionics institutes have been revoked; in actuality, two institutes have retained their charters, now under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence .

One institute remains at its original site at Terra ( Sol / Solomani Rim 1827). The revocation order was cancelled in 1014.

One institute, originally sited at Regina ( Regina / Spinward Marches 1910), has been re-established at Wypoc ( Lanth / Spinward Marches 2011), while retaining a low-level recruiting establishment as part of the naval base at Regina.

Pyramid

Traditional construction form for developing cultures; considered to be the simplest form of large-scale architecture because of its load-bearing strength and ease of assembly. Generally found at TL 1.

Pyramid structures of all sizes have been believed to serve a focusses for psionic (or cosmic) power, and are claimed to sharpen dull edges, cure diseases, and generally work miracles.

Pyramids have been constructed on most worlds where the local culture has passed through TL 1. Many examples remain due to the massive strength of the structure.

Q-ship

A starship designed to lure corsairs by giving the appearance of a weak, poorly-armed merchant ship, but having sufficient combat power to defeat them.

These ships can be a valuable element in anti-pirate forces of many planetary and subsector governments throughout known space. Companies may also purchase Q-ships for use in areas where local governments either cannot or will not control piracy; they find the expense of Q-ships a bargain when a raider which has preyed upon a profitable trade route is finally hunted down.

Most Q-ships range from 200 to 800 tons, matching the range of common merchant ships and freighters. They are even built using the same hull designs, simply adding armour and weaponry. Typically, they mount the maximum number of turrets for the hull size. Any turrets over and above the usual number on a merchant ship are in the form of "pop" turrets. These are similar to the pop turrets found on xboat tenders .

The designs tend to trade cargo space for improved drives and a good computer. Since boarding actions are common, Q-ships normally carry a squad of marines or security personnel trained in such operations. Small craft carried by Q-ships are specially equipped for troop transport.

Quantum
Quantum Mechanics

The indivisible unit in which waves of energy may be emitted or absorbed.

The concept originally arose from asking why a star emitted at all frequencies without generating an infinite amount of energy and exhausting itself. The integer quantum makes only certain frequencies possible: therefore, stars are not emitting at an infinite number of frequencies; therefore, stars do not emit an infinite amount of energy.

Quantum mechanics is the study of physics at the quantum level, rather than the gross level which sophonts naturally perceive.

University of Regina

A broad spectrum planetary institution providing education in all areas; its campuses are scattered all over Regina ( Regina / Spinward Marches 1910). Its greatest strengths are in the social sciences: history, sociology, cultural anthropology, public policy, and political science.

By law, Regina is the only university in the sector allowed to call itself the "U of R". This is a relic dating from when feudal requirements gave Regina, as sector capital and seat of the sector Duke, pride of place. This law is still on the books. However, its students and faculty breezily scorn this distinction and refer to the university simply by the world's name: "Regina".

Repatriation Bond

A repatriation bond is a document guaranteeing passage of an individual to a specified location upon completion of contract work or upon suspension of contract work for any reason. Repatriation bonds are guarantees given as inducements to workers who might otherwise be wary of leaving their own worlds with no assurances that they could return. They are most commonly used by mercenary units.

Repatriation bonds are usually administered by a large financial institution which holds the necessary funds in escrow.

A sample repatriation bond card would be similar to this: The bonding agent shown is Hortalez et Cie, one of the most reputable bonding agents. The possessor can expect that the card will be honoured without delay or problem. The card is sufficient to get the bearer to a place of safety, and then off the stated world (to one of the destination worlds) without additional expense. It need only be presented at the world's starport .

Imperial Research Station

The scattered worlds of the Imperium manifest a wide range of technological levels; this diversity is maintained by the distance between worlds, the high cost of transportation, and the relative independence allowed to worlds within the Imperium.

Nevertheless, the Imperium itself is constantly involved with research projects at the forefronts of technology. While some new technology can be purchased from advanced cultures beyond the Imperial boundaries, such high technology is expensive, and still requires a solid technological foundation to allow its usage. Consider: however useful solid-state chip circuits are, they still require a firm grounding in electronics, and cannot be used on a large scale without electronics, individual solid-state chip components, photo processing, and even crystal culture. It is vital that the Imperium pass through many stages of technological development on the way to achievement in higher tech level areas.

Imperial technological research is performed in two ways: under contract by corporations, or in established Imperial Research Stations. The difference is that corporate (and equivalent privately financed) research is directed at specific practical uses, while Imperial projects are breaking new ground on the forefronts of knowledge. Often this is an attempt to duplicate technology observed or reported in neighbouring cultures and not yet within the ability of Imperial science. At other times, the research is in an area of interest expressed by some Imperial body (such as spinal mount weapons research performed by the Imperial Navy).

Imperial Research Stations may be sited in areas which need the boost to the local economy, or in remote areas far from the potential disturbance of Imperial politics. Many different stations may be working in the same region, and many different areas of knowledge may be under investigation at one time.

In general, however, one station will be constructed for one purpose, and continue in that area of knowledge for its entire span of usefulness. Its size, personnel roster, power plant capacity, and even visibility profile, are dependent on its area of investigation.

Imperial research may delve into many areas. Some examples include anti-matter containment, artificial intelligence, bionics, black globe development, black hole research (both of large-scale and mini black holes), cryptography, deep planetary core soundings, deep radar analysis, disintegrator beams, genetic manipulation, gravity manipulation (advanced), instantaneous transmitter development (so far proving impossible), long-range detection systems, magic (so-called), nova prediction and prevention, personal shields, psionics, psychohistory (mass population behaviour prediction), robotics, stable superheavy elements , stasis and time travel, super-conductors (high-temperature), weaponry research (advanced), and x-ray laser technology.

University of Rhylanor

A technically oriented planetary institution designed primarily to support the 8 billion citizens of Rhylanor ( Rhylanor / Spinward Marches 2716). As befits the needs of the small, high-population, technologically sophisticated world, Rhylanor's academic strengths are the hard sciences: biology, chemistry, electronics, gravitics, mechanics, and physics.

Note that, by law, Rhylanor is not allowed to call itself the "U of R". This picayune regulation is a relic granted to the University of Regina.

Ringworld

An incredibly strong band could be set rotating about a central star, making a ringworld that uses centrifugal force to provide a simulation of gravity.

A ringworld with a radius of 148 million km (93 million miles) and a width of 1.6 million km (1 million miles) would have a usable surface area equal to three million planets the size of Terra ( Sol / Solomani Rim 1827).

Kirshamii Riilam 

In 1090, partially in reaction to the communication lag during the Fourth Frontier War, Senior Scout Kirshamii Riilam mounted a daring one-ship expedition to test the feasibility of a supply station route across the Great Rift.

Although nominally an IISS venture, General Products provided substantial backing and a Seeker-class ship, Reftbreaker. By removing all non-essentials, the cargo space was expanded to provide a second full fuel tank. This increased Reftbreaker's range to 8 parsecs (two jump-4s). After refuelling in a gas giant in the Yoma ( Vast Heavens / Deneb 3031) system, the expedition returned to Corridor by the same route.

Upon their return they were knighted by Emperor Strephon, and Riilam received a baronial fief on Jafla ( Sinta  / Corridor 1840). The expedition's success increased Strephon's popularity. Serious consideration is being given to the idea of planting several ice asteroids mid-rift as a permanent refuelling station.

Sandcaster

Defensive starship weapon that dispenses small particles of a granular agent which obstructs light; when fired it interferes with incoming laser or energy weapon fire and protects the ship.

The specific particles used are similar to ablat personal armor; replacement canisters of this special "sand" weigh about 50 kg and cost Cr400.

Scout/Courier

One of the most commonly encountered ship types in the Imperium is the Type-S scout/courier. Its basic design has remained unchanged for the past century, as the ship is extremely suited to its job as message carrier for the Imperium. Where the xboats don't travel, the scout/couriers must. Even after a long useful life in scout service, the type-S continues to serve on detached duty with retired or ex-Scout personnel.

Estimates of the numbers of scout/couriers in service are arbitrary, as they must work from the counts of those in service, and extrapolate to cover surplus, detached, and foreign scout/couriers; the count ranges from 15,000 to 30,000 in the Imperium, and around 1,000 in the Spinward Marches.

Tough and reliable, the scout/courier is an excellent light travel ship. Commissioned by the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service and designed for exploration, survey, and courier work, it might never be replaced as the best ship for its purpose.

System Defence Boat 
(SDB)

A non- starship (a spaceship) specifically intended for defensive operations inside a star system. Developed on the principle that a spaceship, with increased armament and defences due to lack of jump drives, can normally defeat a starship of equal tonnage. SDB's are typically stationed at the vital points of a system (the gas giants, the asteroid belts, the major world's oceans, and so on) and attack invading vessels according to one or more pre-determined plans.

^^^^
Sea Bears

Sea bears (Pseudoarctos ansonii, et al) are large, dangerous, amphibious carnivores native to Thengo ( Chronor / Spinward Marches 0202), but which have been distributed to a large number of worlds in the Chronor, Jewell, Querion, Lianic ( Gvurrdon ), and Massina ( Foreven ) subsectors, apparently as part of pre-Imperial colonization projects. Also known as the "surfer's nightmare".

Adults are typically 1 to 2 meters long, and weigh upwards of 50 kilograms. The skeleton is calciferous, internal, and generally resembles that of a Terran mammalian vertebrate, except in the number of limbs and in the framing of the body cavity. The spinal column runs from the base of the skull dorsally along the body until it reaches the pelvis. Instead of ribs, the sea bear's body cavity is suppoerted by short lengths of bone joined in what some have described as geodesic fashion (i.e., as a series of mutually interconnected triangles). This arrangement is very sturdy, and provides an excellent protection to the internal organs of the sea bear.

Externally, the most notable external feature of the sea bear is the number of limbs. Oddly enough for an animal of its size, the sea bear has four pairs of limbs: one posterior locomotory pair, one anterior pair used in defense and food acquisition, and two medial pairs which can serve either purpose. The head is typical, a bony cranium to protect the brain, upon which are mounted paired sensory organs (eyes, nostrils, ears) and a ventrally located mouth. The nose is located well forward, apparently as an adaptation for breathing while partially submerged.

Sea bears are carnivorous, and are usually found along seashores and in shallow off-shore areas of large bodies of water. Sea bears are solitary hunters, preying upon small aquatic and semi-aquatic animal life. The sea bear usually hunts by swimming slowly along the surface, and diving upon its prey from above, taking it by surprise. Its eight strong limbs make it powerful enough to hunt even in the surf zone.

During the mating season, sea bears will congregate in huge groups, sometimes consisting of hundreds of individuals. These groups settle for several weeks on an island or peninsula protected from dangers to the young, where male and female sea bears engage in a mating ritual not fully documented. Each pair eventually produces one to three young.

As soon as the young are able to travel (usually after six to eight weeks), the group breaks up into family units, which care for the young until they are able to fend for themselves (usually after six months). The family units then break up until the next mating season. Some observers have reported scattered instances of sea bears mating for life, and hunting as a team.

Seaharvester
LIC

Founded in 933, Seaharvester specialises in gathering the resources of the oceans of several worlds in the Solomani Rim region.

Noted as pioneers in techniques of seabed mining, sea farming, seawater metals reclamation, and the breeding and herding of various species of useful marine creatures, Seaharvester was purchased outright by SuSAG LIC in 1096. The SuSAG purchase was made to ensure a constant source of the organics required for several of the megacorporation's pharmaceuticals, which Seaharvester provided.

Sector-Wide Lines

Sector-wide lines are large merchant lines which serve the major worlds within a sector. They are fed by subsector-wide lines, and they serve as feeders to the megacorporation lines.

Sector-wide lines dominate the major trade routes within the sector, and provide limited service to adjacent sectors.

An example of an Imperial sector-wide line is Al Morai.

Senlis Foederate

The Senlis Foederate is a small independent trading and defence alliance within the Pax Rulin subsector, Trojan Reach.

It consists of the systems of Senlis ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 2108), Orsach ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 2008) and Magen ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 2309). The worlds form the first stage of a known jump route across the Outrim Void.

The Foederate has trade connections with the Imperium and with the agricultural worlds of Kydde ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 1810) and Bantral ( Pax Rulin / Trojan Reach 1906), both within the Void.

Sensors

Sensors detect the presence of target objects either by detecting energy emitted by the target or by reflecting energy off them and detecting the reflection. The first type of sensor is known as a passive sensor, since it does not emit energy of its own. The second type is known as an active sensor, since it projects energy and bounces it off the target object.

Passive Sensors
Passive EMS uses large antenna arrays to detect any radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) from the target object, such as heat or radio waves, or naturally reflected light waves. It is an extremely sophisticated and precise passive sensor.

High-Resolution Thermal (HRT) are sophisticated visual sensors, sensitive to infrared radiation.

Densitometers are passive survey instruments which allow determination of celestial object mass and mapping of mineral deposits and gravitic anomalies.

Neutrino Sensors are passive sensors used when surveying a star system . They enable a ship to measure the intensity of fusion taking place within a star as well as determine if any of the gas giants are failed stars.

Neural Activity Sensors (NAS) are extremely short-range passive sensors which detect and classify life forms according to their level of brain activity.

Active Sensors
Radar is an active sensor which bounces radio waves off target objects and then detects the returning echoes. Distance is determined by the time it takes for the echo to return. Doppler radar is used to determine if an object is moving.

Ladar is a tight beam active sensor that bounces laser light off the target object and detects the reflection. As the laser can scan a very small area, it is used exclusively to lock onto a target after some other search sensor has located it.

Active EMS is an active sensor incorporating a variety of active emitters and passive detectors covering most of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS), making it a much more sophisticated version of radar.

Shivva-class Patrol Frigate

Ubiquitous Zhodani Navy design most frequently encountered of the types deployed on and beyond the Consular frontier districts. The class is deployed on various independent picket, communications, and patrol duties, often well beyond Zhodani borders. The crew is known to include a Psionic Adept, who in addition to normal navigation duties is believed to augment the range and strength of a special communications system, which may explain the posting - Adepts are usually only assigned to capital classes of vessel.

Names of the class generally end in -va ("light", thus Shivva = moonlight); some examples include: Alekrva, Brnava, Doruva, Jadsva, Jirtodva, Loyhva, Mielrva, Shivva, Uturva.

Shudusham Robotics Conference

In 404, a group of roboticists met at Shudusham ( Core / Core 2214) to share their latest technological breakthroughs. Shudusham was chosen as the site because of its historical significance (SEE Shudusham Concords) and central location. The conference was a success; so much so, in fact, that the Shudusham Robotics Conference has continued to meet every ten years. Roboticists , manufacturers, heavy robot users, journalists, and other interested parties are drawn from all over explored space to attend a portion of the one-year conference. The last conference was in 1103; the next is due in 1113.

The Karrigashu Undersea Habitat is used only to host the conference. It can support 300,000 people. About 250,000 of the 400,000 attendees are present at any time. Its Robotics Museum, library, and laboratory are popular with attendees.

Shriekers

Intelligent minor race native to Shvreeyiyi.

The Shriekers are a pseudo-mammalian race with four pairs of limbs and three pairs of eyes. Each pair of eyes is specialised for a different area of sight: distant sight, near sight (less than 1 meter), and infrared sight. One pair of limbs are used as hands ("manipulators"), and the other three pairs are used for locomotion. However, these limbs are short and the Shriekers can only move relatively slowly. The Shriekers have therefore developed a prosthetic device known as "walking legs". These legs are essentially jointed stilts, harnessed to the six walking limbs, that raise the Shriekers above the ground to allow more rapid travel. Since use of these stilts requires a surgical modification to the limb joints, these Shriekers are permanently crippled if their walking legs are taken from them. However, Shriekers skilled with these legs are able to perform any and all activities without removing them.

Shriekers reproduce sexually via sacs of eggs which are protected and fertilised outside of the body, one at a time. These unfertilised eggs are known to Imperials unaware of their actual nature as "Denuli gems" and can fetch as much as Cr10,000 each. However, Shriekers will not permit such use of their unborn offspring.

This delicate, iridescent material is strong for its weight, and a shurshi garment retains its beauty for many years. This fantastically expensive substance is produced by an insect native to Zurrian ( xxxxx / Vland nnnn) which has been altered and conditioned to spin its webbing in sheets. The cleaned cloth is shipped beyond the sector - for those who can afford it. Attempts to raise these insects elsewhere have failed.

Shuulamane

Insect-like creature native to Khula ( Vland / Vland 1920), the shuulamane was accidentally introduced to Vland ( Vland / Vland 1717) around -2450. The animal is now so common (and so obvious when encountered) that most Vilani do not realize that the shuulamane is not a native species.

The creature is ugly and rodent-like, with dull greenish-gray fur covering its body, except for the head, which is smooth and has no apparent ears. The most obvious feature of the shuulamane is the product of its two powerful scent glands, used to mark carrion and prevent other species from interfering with its find.

Unfortunately, the shuulamane reproduces quickly, with up to four litters of six to ten young each during Vland's (Vland / Vland 1717) long year. The shuulamane can be found in almost every region of Vland (Vland / Vland 1717) with a temperate climate, although eradication of the species in the larger cities has been mostly successful.

The shuulamane is the subject of many Vilani proverbs and folktales, all attesting to the animal's vices of stupidity, laziness, cowardice, foul odor, and lack of cleanliness.

Society for the Protection of Terra

Society founded by Admiral Donald Mason in the 1050s, several decades after the Solomani Rim War.

Members of the Society for the Protection of Terra (SPT) recommend that Terra be kept under Imperial rule, and not be allowed self-government again. They argue that since humaniti originated on Terra, the world should be administered as a preserve by the Imperium, and not be given the chance to rebel again, "endangering our glorious heritage and the planet of our origins."

The group is strongest in the Vland sector.

Springers

Springers (Arachnofelis var.), also called cave spiders, spider-cats and shrew-spiders, are eight-limbed quasi-mammalian carnivores. Their origin world is not known, but they are found throughout the coreward regions of the Imperium. Although spread widely by the mysterious Ancients, their range was increased considerably by colonists of the First Imperium, as a means for biological pest control.

Massing between 250 and 500 grams, springers average 15 centimeters in length. For reasons not completely understood, springers evolved from a four-limbed form. Each limb evolved into two, the upper portions shortening almost into non-existence. The powerful rear legs are adapted to leaping, and the remaining limbs are used for clinging to prey while poison (from two glands in the mouth) is injected.

Silk is excreted by glands in the upper chest area, which is hairless to prevent tangling. Two modified "thumbs" are used to draw the silk from the glands and manipulate it into a web. The silk produced is adhesive only when excreted, drying rapidly to a thick rope. Webs woven of it are coarse networks which signal the presence and location of prey.

Springer skeleton (artist Liz Danforth, used with permission of Liz Danforth <www.oakheart.com> and Marc Miller)Springers are hermaphroditic. Young are born live at any season, in litters of three to five. Since most of their milk glands have evolved into producing silk, springers supplement their youngs' diet with regurgitated, partially digested food.

Springers normally inhabit caves, dense forests, and rock crevices, but can often be found inhabiting piles of rubble and deserted buildings. While not normally dangerous to humans, their bite is painful, and the venom can cause death due to allergic reaction in some individuals.

Starmerc

Mercenary organizations licensed to operate military starships.

Licenses range from 10-ton fighters to 5,000-ton vessels, with one charter for a 20,000-ton retired battle rider used as an SDB. Most vessels are in the 300 to 1,000-ton range.

Most organizations obtain their vessels from the Imperial Navy as surplus. Nearly any ship of 50 years or older is an excellent candidate for starmerc services.

Subsector-Wide Lines

A subsector-wide line serves major star systems within a subsector, although some service may be extended to systems in adjacent subsectors. The key word is major; a subsector-wide line typically serves between one-quarter to one-third of the worlds within the subsector. The routes operated connect worlds off the main trade routes with those on the main routes. Subsectorwide lines also create their own routes connecting especially lucrative markets.

Subsector-wide lines also extend their service to selected major worlds in adjacent subsector.

Subsector-wide lines serve as feeders to sector-wide lines, while they are themselves fed by fledgling lines and occasional free traders.

An example of a subsector-wide line is Sinzarmes.

Superheavy Elements

Although elements heavier than uranium are increasingly unstable and radioactive (with half-lives measured in fractions of a second), quantum theory predicts an island of stability, consisting of the elements with atomic numbers 114 to 122, which have half-lives measured in the millions of years.

These superheavy elements, also called eka-metals or island metals, are generated in small amounts in supernova explosions. Only a few grams have ever been discovered in nature, which is just enough for scientists to determine that superheavies would be immensely valuable to industry if a source could be found.

Terran Prime
Terran Norm

Terran Prime and Terran Norm are classification terms given to worlds with certain desirable physical characteristics.

Terran Prime (T-prime) worlds are worlds similar to the Terran standard type; such worlds are highly prized as habitations. To be classed as Terran Prime, a world's physical characteristics must fall within the following ranges:

Size 6 - 9 
Atmosphere 4 - 9 
Hydrography 3 - 9 
Gravity 0.6 - 1.1G 

Within this category is the Terran Norm (T-norm) type:

Size 7 - 9 
Atmosphere 6 - 7 
Hydrography 5 - 7 
Gravity 0.75 - 1.1G 

This latter classification almost guarantees successful colonisation or tourist industries.

Note that the actual UPP of Terra ( Sol / Solomani Rim 1827) is A-867A69-F.

TANSTAAFL

Acronym for the phrase "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch".

Used by jaded travellers who believe, often through personal experience, that you cannot get something for nothing. The original idea appears to have originated on old Earth, where a sign proclaiming patrons could receive a "free lunch" merely meant the drinks cost twice as much as in other places.

The concept has expanded into the realm of economics, which suggests that someone ends up paying the cost of the "lunch". Even in cases where there is no individual cost, there may well be a social cost. Similarly, someone may benefit from a public good (e.g. a free public transport network) but someone still has to pay the cost of providing this benefit (e.g. the taxpayers).

Travellers' Aid Society ( TAS )

The Travellers' Aid Society (TAS) is a private organisation which maintains hostels and facilities at all class A and B starports in many parts of human space. Facilities are available (at reasonable cost) to members and their guests.

TAS membership may be acquired upon mustering out of a service. It is given as a reward for heroism or extraordinary service to the Society, rather than an "official" benefit of the service involved.

Membership may also (less frequently) be purchased, at a cost of MCr1. This is not as prestigious a way of receiving TAS, and people who attempt to buy this "free" gift are often black-balled and refused entry.

Membership is for the life of the character and is not transferable. The Traveller's Aid Society invests its membership fees and other income; it uses its capital to provide benefits to members. Every two months it pays dividends in the form of one High Passage ticket to each member. This ticket may be used, retained, or sold.

Tavrchedl'

Literally meaning "Guardians of Our Morality", the Tavrchedl' are the Zhodani "Thought Police".

The infamous Thought Police are a branch of the Zhodani government charged with maintaining right thought by the population. Primarily an internal attitude and security police, their responsibility is internal order within the Zhodani Consulate. Effectively they operate as a secret police force constantly spying on the population with psionics. Their mission is to catch anyone who is discontent with the system, their lot in life, or their superiors, and to brainwash them into acceptance of the system. This brainwashing is known as re-education.

The Tavrchedl' are also charged with locating and removing agents of external powers from the Zhodani Consulate.

During the Frontier Wars, the Thought Police are responsible for the administration of occupied Imperial worlds. The military government is concerned primarily with maintaining a safe and docile population, and proven methods of achieving such a condition include some brutal exploits to prove they are serious, followed by inclusion of locals into the governing process. The people that are included often receive a quick re-education and then take their position with sincerity and dedication to the Zhodani cause. To the rest of the population, the individual appears to be brainwashed or coerced.

Teahleikhoi

Famous Aslan mercenary regiment based in the Reavers' Deep sector. The name Teahleikhoi can be translated as "Soldiers of the Falling Night", "Knights of the Setting Sun", or "Warriors of the Evening Star".

Organized and operated as a regiment based in the Uhtaa subsector of Reavers' Deep, the Teahleikhoi regiment is fairly typical of mercenary units that are found in the Hierate. The corporation controlling the unit was organized some 150 years ago by an unmarried female of the Iyhlua clan, and has maintained continuity through a series of handpicked successors to this day. The current owner, Iyhli, is a distant relative of the founder. Like all of the corporation's senior executives, she will hold her post until she dies or is married; at that time, her own chosen successor will take charge of the business.

The regiment proper is set up to handle a variety of situations and circumstances, from formal clan wars within the Hierate to operations without rules cutside the Aslan sphere of influence. Ships supplied by Larleaftea Hryawaorwya, the prominent shipbuilding firm, are essential to the unit's operations, giving the regiment flexible interstellar mobility, and control and support at the scene of battle.

The regiment can mount operations of any size that may be required, from actions involving a single company up to the commitment of the entire regiment. There are thirteen ships available to the unit: nine 3000-ton Eiaikeiar (Hero)-class Intruder Transports for company-level transportation, three 3000-ton Tleiatre (Warlord)-class Battle Leaders for command and control purposes, and a large regimental command ship of 5,000 tons equipped to coordinate large-scale operations. This last ship can carry a small fighter squadron, and transports various other support units as required when the regiment as a whole is committed in combat.

The regiment is typical for this size of Aslan mercenary force, though there are many variations from one unit to the next. Even the composition of the Teahleikhoi regiment itself has varied in the past, as it has adapted to a variety of changing circumstances. Through it all, though, one essential fact has remained unchanged. The regiment is still Teahleikhoi, with history, traditions, and honor unchanged over a century and a half of warfare in and out of the Hierate. That fact is a proud tradition for the soldiers of the regiment to bear.

Terraforming

The process of altering a planetary environment to improve habitability. Named in reference to Terra ( Sol / Solomani Rim 1827), the original homeworld of humaniti.

Global terraforming involves making substantial improvements on a world with an unfavorable global environment. An example is terraforming a world with an insidious atmosphere into one with a standard atmosphere.

Total terraforming involves complete transformation of a world's basic environment to a radically different basic environment of one's choosing. An example would be terraforming a barren vacuum world into a lush, rich world with a dense atmosphere.

The Three

This religion holds that there three deities of equal power but different outlook. One is good, one is evil, and the third mediates between the other two. Doctrine is dedicated to the precepts of law and order.

Imperial scholars believe that the religion began in Zhodani space long ago. Worship of the Three flourishes in the Imperium, but it is nevertheless watched by Imperial authorities.

A popular holy symbol is a group of three small, identical objects (preferably gems or crystals) worn around the wrist, neck, or head. Most believers are traditionalists. A number of church officials have publicly supported right wing political candidates.

Tlaosierlahrau

A spice derived from the seed of the tlaosiear, a tree found on Roakhoi ( Ea / Reavers' Deep 1224). Also known as tlaospice, tlao, or seasongold.

The golden seed kernels, when ground, produce a fragrant, light seasoning popular with both Aslan and human gourmets on meat, soups, and stews. Because of the scarcity of tlaosiear and the expense of shipping it, tlaospice commands an impressive price of Cr3 per gram in offworld markets.

Tlaserlaahel

An interface line operating between the Aslan Hierate and worlds in Reavers' Deep sector, this merchant corporation is controlled by the Yehaso clan, a strong Aslan group on Roaa ( Uhtaa / Reavers' Deep 0237).

Tlasayerlaahel is a powerful company with many interests in the Deep, among them the tlaospice trade with Roakhoi ( Ea / Reavers' Deep 1224), the rithscent trade with Htalrea ( Ea / Reavers' Deep 1226), and some commercial contact with the natives of Gaajpadge ( Ea / Reavers' Deep 1124), from whom glasswares and other objects d'art are obtained.

Tlaserlaahel is currently engaged in stiff economic competition with the human merchants of Caledon Ventures, Ltd.

Travel Suit

The Travel Suit (or TeeSuit) is a garment especially designed for Dolphins. This garment is a combination gravitic vehicle and environment suit, which contains a super-humid atmosphere for the health and comfort of its wearer. Early versions are available at TL 12, cost Cr125,000, weigh 12 kg (with the grav modules turned off), and provide fairly comfortable support for up to 12 hours. By TL 15, the cost has increased to Cr150,000 but the suit only weighs 7 kg, and provides very comfortable accomodations for up to 48 hours.

In all cases, the helmet includes a polylucent cuprothallium visor with a full heads-up display tied into an on-board computer/communication array. This system is equivalent to a hand computer in data processing power with a regional (500 km) range audio/video transceiver capability.

The suit is capable of flight at up to 100 kph. Normal cruise speed is only about 75 kph and NOE speed is 20 kph. In combat, the suit is equal to cloth-1 (TL 12-13) and cloth-2 (TL 14+). The TeeSuit provides its wearer with complete protection from temperatures ranging from -100 degrees C to +100 degrees C, and pressures of up to 5 atm. Waldos are an optional extra.

A combat version exists (Type D battle dress) with the same armour rating as human battle dress. It includes a sonar amplifier (range 1 km), integral waldos, and a chameleon surface, often set to dark grey above blending to light grey/white on the lower surface. A special snout ram can be fitted, as well as a torpedo rack.

True Humanity Society

This radical group believes that when the Ancients brought humaniti from Terra ( Sol  / Solomani Rim 1827) they took the sentient Terrans and left only the subhuman "apemen" of Terra. They also believe that pure-blooded Vilani should cooperate with the Zhodani and some of the minor races to "put the apes back in the zoo" (i.e. Terra).

After its founding by Sunaam Parshish and Khadu Shaa in 1076 and a few brief years of activity, the True Humanity Society is now almost extinct.

Tyeyo Fteahrao Yolr

Aslan interface line.

During the period immediately after the Aslan Border Wars (around 380 to 500), the Aslan discovered dust-spice, a novel spice which appealed to Aslan tastes, but which was available only in the Spinward Marches. When Aslan traders realised the Aslan Hierate would be a large market for dust-spice, Tyeyo Fteahrao Yolr (literally "Tyeyo Dust-spice Importers") was established to import the novelty.

Since then, synthetic dust-spice has become available, and natural dust-spice is now a gourmet treat but no longer imported in great quantities. Tyeyo Fteahrao Yolr instead seeks out and imports any novel novel or valuable trade goods along the route from Mora ( Mora / Spinward Marches 3124) to the Aslan capital of Kusyu ( Kilrai' / Dark Nebula 1919).

Home Port: Kusyu ( Kilrai' / Dark Nebula 1919).

Territory: Dark Nebula, Ealiyasiyw, Riftspan Reaches Trojan Reach, and the Spinward Marches sectors.

Uncertainty Principle

In quantum physics, a principle that states you can never be exactly sure of both the position and the velocity of an atomic particle. The more accurately you know one of these properties, the less accurately you can know the other.

This is not an observational problem. Rather, quantum particles have an intrinsic uncertainty: they do not have well-defined positions and momentum.

Vekkur

Vilani religion believing a Supreme Being applies a universal law to judge the conduct of all sentient life. A believer's fate in the afterlife depends on understanding and observing that law. Members use no holy symbols, but always wear some form of white garment.

Most noted as pacifists, the Vekkur believe that all things have an equal right to live. They seek to never harm life, and will not kill under any circumstances. The name Vekkur comes from a mythical Vilani creature able to cure disease which the Supreme Being sent as proof of his existence.

Vlazhdumecta

General name given to the original colonists who settled much of the Far Frontiers region. Their origins are obscure, but they are believed to have been a minor race of humaniti flourishing in the Afachtiabr sector some 6000 years ago, during the early period of Zhodani interstellar expansion. The race absorbed a great deal of culture and technology from the Zhodani. They founded a wide-spread mercantile and commercial empire that included the Far Frontiers sector.

Zhodani absorption of the Vlazhdumecta homeworlds triggered the breakdown of their interstellar civilization. Far from being self-sufficient, most of their colonies lapsed into barbarism. Few ever recovered.

Vlazhdumecta composed the basic population of most settled Far Frontiers worlds until settlers from the Third Imperium came 800-900 years ago. Except for certain anomalies, no trace of Vilani / Solomani orientation or influence appeared in the Far Frontiers until then.

Heinrich Volkstrangler 

Homicidal maniac who personally engineered the Invasion of Utoland (1103). Born into a military family on the high-population world of Trin ( Trin's Veil / Spinward Marches 3235), Volkstrangler pursued an illustrious career through the Imperial Marines. He rose to the rank of Force Commander, receiving many decorations, the pinnacle of which was the Starburst For Extreme Heroism , won while serving aboard the battleship ISS  Golden Redemption . Volkstrangler was also elevated from Baron to Marquis for his Marine service.

This record contrasts greatly with his later actions. In 1103 he organised a small, high-tech invasion force which overran Utoland ( Jewell / Spinward Marches 1209) within two weeks. In the process, he infiltrated and captured the Adamdun, a Kinunir-class battle cruiser, and used it to support the invasion.

Volkstrangler was presumed killed when the Imperial counter-strike freed Utoland . However, recent reports suggest that the Adamdun currently resides in the Sword Worlds, so it is possible that Volkstrangler is still alive.

Waldos

A waldo is a type of mechanical manipulation device, taking the form of an artificial arm and hand.

The first uses of waldos were to manipulate objects in hostile or dangerous environments, such as in "hot cells" in radiation labs. Later they were used by humans as an alternative (or an adjunct to) artificial limbs. People who were too crippled or injured to use conventional prosthetics could have waldos fitted to their travel chairs. Also, some races (most notibly, some of the Solomani "uplifted" species) must use waldos to substitute for their lack of "hands".

The major example of waldos used by a species is the case of the Dolphins. Early versions (TL 9) were worn as a harness or mounted on a TeeSuit, and were controlled by movements of the tongue and head. They were vary clumsy and weak, only able to move weights of 25 kg or less. They cost Cr150,000 and weigh 20 kg.

At TL 12, medical and robotic advances allow the surgical implanting of neural control plugs in Dolphins. Waldos can then be directly controlled by the brain of the user, becoming far less clumsy. At TL 15, Dolphins using waldos are as adept as humans. Strength is also enhanced, allowing objects of up to 100 kg to be freely manipulated. Cost of the operation is Cr150,000 at TL 12, dropping by Cr15,000 at each subsequent tech level. TL 12 waldos cost Cr250,000 and weigh 10 kg.

Afeahyalhtow

Afeahyalhtow, Winged life-form native to the Aslan homeworld, Kusyu ( Kilrai' / Dark Nebula 1919). Its scientific name is Aculeoptera venator; human names are winger, batsting, or falconbat. These carnivore/killer flyers mass roughly 1 kg, and have a wingspan of .75 metres. Their lower limbs have evolved as grasping claws to carry prey or perch on tree limbs or high rocks.

Afeahyalhtow have sharp eyesight, with cat-like eyes that can adjust to a wide range of lighting conditions. They soar at high altitudes, then swoop down on prey. One claw can inject a poison which paralyses within a few minutes. Its effects wear off after about an hour. The venom is not usually harmful to creatures over 5 kg, but can be deadly to humans who develop an allergic reaction. The primary purpose of the poison is to slow the prey or render it unconcious, allowing the afeahyalhtow to feed (it prefers live meat). Teeth and claws can only do a little damage to the prey, but this is sufficient to make an excellent meal for the afeahyalhtow. The beast then feeds for a few minutes before departing.

Domesticated long before the Aslan achieved star flight, afeahyalhtow are popular as pets, and are found almost anywhere Aslan are found. They are independent, somewhat aloof, but capable of strong affection and attachment - often likened to cats in human space. As pets, they are relatively gentle and companionable, but most humans find their feeding habits distasteful. Afeahyalhtow eat almost any variety of small animals or raw meat.

Domesticated afeahyalhtow are raised and trained much as falcons and garhawks in human space. Properly trained, they can be used to track and hunt prey; such trained hunters will administer poison to the prey, but will feed only when permitted to do so by their owner. Training of an afeahyalhtow takes a moderate hunting skill and 6-12 months before the animal will respond to commands (usually various whistle and tongue-clicking signals). A hunter's ability is much improved when using these sharp-eyed animals!



Afeahyalhtow respond poorly to being caged; they become listless, lose their hunting spirit, and eventually die. Most owners let them fly free, after attaching small straps around their feet to prevent the stinger claw from functioning. On a starship, they usually require an hour or two per day of flying in the ship's cargo compartment or some other open space. Afeahyalhtow can fly in any standard or dense atmosphere, and in thin atmospheres on worlds with a size of 4 or less. Their size and build prevents them from being outfitted with protective gear, so they are rarely seen outdoors on worlds with tainted (or worse) atmospheres. Afeahyalhtow are not common in human space, except on worlds heavily settled by Aslan colonists. Some humans do keep them as pets, and they command high prices commercially.

In the Domain of Deneb, the family was represented by the Marquis of Aramis in the Spinward Marches, and the Duke of Star Lane in Deneb. The Civil War and Collapse took a very heavy toll of both the BTC Tukera's. The company withdrew from the Domain in 1124, leaving the local branches stranded. The Collapse destroyed the company proper, leaving the survivors with a mountain of debts and handfuls of now worthless stock certificates. But to their great credit, and political skill, the family has managed to survive its adversities, and the Aramis Tukeras have even regained most of their prosperity.

Research Station Eta

Imperial research facility on Judice/Plankwell (SM 1337). Judice has a corrosive atmosphere with high amounts of nitric acid. Despite this hellish environment, extremely hardy life has begun evolving in the worlds nitric acid "seas". Since 1103 Eta has studied these lifeforms, and subsequent surveys showed that the local biosphere was even more significant in extent than previously thought. Eta has been run by Kaldi Research since 1155, and has been expanded to do research in severe environment conditions, and fluidic research biochemistry.
